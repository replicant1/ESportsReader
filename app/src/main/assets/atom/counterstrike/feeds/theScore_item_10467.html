Next up was OpTic&#39;s pick on Cache, which went to overtime, but OpTic tied the series after taking the map 19-16.</p><p>The deciding map was on Dust 2, which was not a particularly strong map for either team and they traded rounds in the first half to go to a 8-7 scoreline in slight favor of OpTic. However, IMT got a ton of momentum after winning the second pistol round and ended the map with a 16-12 to win the map and the tournament.</p><p>felps stepped up for IMT during the event as he was the single-highest rated player in the tournament with an HLTV player rating of 1.42, dwarfing the next highest players, coldzera, who had a 1.28 rating and hen1, who had a 1.26 rating.</p><p><em>Dennis "<strong>Tarmanydyn</strong>" Gonzales is a news editor for theScore esports who enjoys whiskey, D&amp;D and first-picking <s>Abaddon</s> <s>Slardar</s> <s>Clinkz</s> <s>Medusa</s> <s>Oracle</s> <s>a</s> <s>P90</s> my Souvenir Negev. <a href="http://twitter.com/Tarmanydyn">You can follow him on Twitter</a>.</em></p><p><small>
