            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[Gameplay]<br />
– The first-person camera of players, spectators, and demo-viewers is no longer allowed to rise higher than their third-person head. This should prevent first-person players from being able to see from perspectives where their third-person head is not also exposed.<br />
– When a player’s first-person camera is adjusted, bullets fired from both their client and server-side locations are also adjusted to emit from the corrected position.<br />
– If for any reason the third-person player animation lowers a player’s head beneath the client’s first-person camera, the client’s first-person camera is lowered to stay at or under the height of their third-person head. This means that the third-person motion of the player is now represented more accurately from the first-person perspective.<br />
– Third-person landing recovery animations are now weighted based on altitude traversed and duration in-air. Players landing from small jumps or falling from lesser heights will play more subtle landing animations.<br />
– The anti-crouch-spam system has been changed to use degrading speed, instead of logging keypress-count. As before, the more often players crouch, the slower they will rise or lower. But this should now prevent bugs where players would instantly stand, or lose their crouch-spam penalty by moving a tiny amount. If players crouch even more, eventually they will just stay standing up.<br />
– First-person and third-person crouch speed is now more closely related. The third-person player lowers more quickly to match the first-person representation.<br />
– Players landing in crouch positions play a more subtle landing animation that raises their third-person head less noticeably.<br />
&#8211; Molotovs are no longer extinguished by smokes that are significantly below them, so now it is possible to smoke inside hut on Nuke and throw a molotov on top of hut, or smoke under palace balcony on Mirage and throw a molotov on balcony floor.<br />
&#8211; Molotovs are no longer extinguished by smokes that are above the fire height.<br />
&#8211; Molotovs no longer spread under closed doors.<br />
&#8211; Smoke grenades no longer get stuck in player clips when they extinguish flames upon bouncing off a wall.</p>
<p>[Sound]<br />
&#8211; Increased fidelity and reduced distortion for fire sounds for AWP, SSG 08, G3SG1 and SCAR-20.<br />
&#8211; Added unique reload, distant and draw sounds for SSG 08, G3SG1 and SCAR-20.<br />
&#8211; Gunshot tails for AWP, SSG 08, G3SG1 and SCAR-20 no longer remain at the position they were fired, and instead more accurately spread over the environment.</p>
<p>[Maps]<br />
– Latest version of de_cache, minor bug fixes.</p>
<p>[Misc]<br />
– Lag compensation system will now reliably restore pose parameters responsible for animation layering which makes server-side hitboxes for lag compensated players better match client-side rendered models. (Thanks, /u/Spurks)<br />
– Fixed a bug where player body pitch could improperly rotate the entire player entity inside lag compensation processing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[UI]<br />
&#8211; Radar is no longer hidden when win panel comes up.<br />
&#8211; Shipping changes to how some UI elements are implemented in preparation for a move to Panorama UI. This should have no noticeable change in UI functionality, but is the first step in moving to the new system.<br />
&#8212; Please report any UI regressions to csgoteamfeedback@valvesoftware.com and include #UIFeedback in the subject heading.</p>
<p>[SOUNDS]<br />
&#8211; Increased fidelity of firing sounds for P90, MP7 and MP9<br />
&#8211; Added unique reload and draw sounds for P90, MP7 and MP9<br />
&#8211; Slightly reduced volume of firing for recently changed weapon sounds<br />
&#8211; Made headphones the default sound option instead of two-speaker. (If playing with headphones or sound cards with virtual 5.1/7.1 enabled, make sure 5.1 is selected in the CSGO audio settings menu instead.)</p>
<p>[NETWORKING]<br />
&#8211; Networked viewangle precision to other players is now lossless.</p>
<p>[MINOR WEAPON BUGS]<br />
&#8211; Updated the autobuy and rebuy scripts to support 2x flashbangs and reordered the purchasing order (in case of insufficient funds.)<br />
&#8211; Added tracers to alt fire on Aug, Sg, Glock, and Famas.<br />
&#8211; Set all shotguns except XM to semi-auto.<br />
&#8211; AWP and SSG08 now also drop magazines<br />
&#8211; (Thanks, SlothSquadron)</p>
<p>[MISC]<br />
&#8211; Fixed a server crash (Thanks, Gamemann, for the report)<br />
&#8211; Fixed bug where non-Latin characters could not be stored in config files.</p>
<p>[MAC/LINUX]<br />
&#8211; Fixed bug where demoui, console, and other controls wouldn&#8217;t show an &#8216;X&#8217; to close the window.</p>
