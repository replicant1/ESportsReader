		<description><![CDATA[After a lot of community discussion Blizzard reacted quite rapidly and announced Arena balance changes a few days ago. As a first step, they announced to ban a total of 45 cards from Arena. All classes with the exception of Paladin will get cards removed. In Mage and Rogue, overpowered cards like Faceless Summoner or Goblin Auto Barber will leave the game. Paladin seems to be in the right spot with no changes scheduled. All of the other classes should improve with the changes as poor performing cards are pulled out of the format. Overall, this seems to be a step in the right direction but I am sure it is only the beginning of a ongoing initiative to improve Arena. For full details continue reading the whole blue post below.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[September season has started and Blizzard revealed a new card back we can collect by finishing rank 20 or above in this month ranked play mode, either Standard or Wild. The demon theme is totally in line with World of Warcraft&#8217;s newest expansion &#8220;Legion&#8221;. Go grab it you demon-lovers! With the 4th and last wing of &#8220;One Night in Karazhan&#8221; (ONiK) right around the corner, Blizzard might also suggest to play a totally negelected card: Pit Lord.  Perhaps this demon is viable if played alongside Violet Illusionist, which you can unlock tonight&#8230; To read the full blue post, continue below.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Introduction / Genreral Information The Spire is the fourth and last wing of One Night in Karazhan (ONiK). It will open its doors for NA Hearthstone players this  tomorrow, Thursday, September 1st. The rest of the world will have to wait a few hours longer, normally around 4-8 hours which is about the time of midnight to early morning CET. If you want to buy the wing, it will cost you 700 gold or 7 US$. Let&#8217;s take a look at this week&#8217;s cards&#8230; Cards of &#8220;The Spire&#8221; Card Predictions I kindly invite you to take a look back at our Karazhan Card Evaluation #1 to #7 articles or to head to my Karazhan Power Rankings. The 4th and last wing of the Karazhan adventure has IMHO the most difficult card yet to be evaluated. Nevertheless, there is a lot of exiting stuff and a lot of unknown variables associated with the cards. Let’s do not linger ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Danny Donuts here again. Right now we are halfway through the release of the new cards from ONiK. This article will be a recap of what has happened in the past few weeks as the Wings of Karazan have released. It is really interesting to see some of the decks that have been made viable by the new cards introduced, and how the meta changes week by week. These comments that I am making should be taken with a grain of salt, as the meta is currently in flux, and these decks that are currently good may not be as the meta is shaken more by the next two weeks, or as it settles down in the upcoming months. Week 1 Great Priest of the Feast I believe that everyone complaining about Purify really led to this card being underestimated. At this point, it has been extremely powerful in ]]></description>

Let&#8217;s take a look at this week&#8217;s cards&#8230; Cards of &#8220;The Menagerie&#8221; Card Predictions As in last week’s preview, I will not talk about every single card in this article again, as we already did individual initial reviews. I kindly invite you to take a look back at our Karazhan Card Evaluation #1 to #7 articles or to head to my Karazhan Power Rankings.

		<description><![CDATA[The 2nd wing for One Night in Karazhan has been released and I think this week you&#8217;ll find yourself taking a lot less time navigating through this wing as last week&#8217;s took. In fact, these deck lists should not only get you to one shot them on normal, but there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll one shot them on heroic as well. It might take a couple extra tries but for the most part, this week was fairly easy. Julianne Julianne is invincible for as long as Romulo is on the board. Her hero power brings back Romulo who is a 4/2 minion. She plays a lot of taunt minions and goes face a lot. The strategy here is to control the board as much as possible, keep yourself healed up and kill Romulo when you have additional minions to hit her face. For this fight I went with a Reno ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One Night in Karazhan has dropped and the Prologue mission (free) and the The Parlor (first wing) is now open. Two of the boss battles on these use pre-constructed decks and I provided some videos below of the heroic versions. The other two heroic bosses require you to develop your own decks, and in this instance I found I could use the same deck list with ease for both encounters. If you&#8217;d like to see what cards you get for completing the wings this week make sure to check our spoiler list. Prologue &#8211; Prince Malchezaar This fight is all about recycling your spells and trying to get really big turns where you can pop off spells, get a ton of spell damage and just destroy your opponent. You can be more selective of getting certain spells back than I was, but it still seemed to work. Silverware Golem He ]]></description>
