            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patch 4.20 brought with it a number of new changes to League of Legends entering the 2015 pre-season. Many of the changes were hotly discussed and analyzed, particularly in the jungle. You should start buff camp! You should start small camp! Is that a crab? Who cares, pick Warwick, and so on. Amidst all of the discussion of towers and jungles and new items, Riot slid in a subtle but important change to mana regeneration items, as well as to over 40 champions. I’m Eph289 and I’ve written this piece to provide an in-depth breakdown of what 4.20 (and subsequently 4.21) did to mana regen.</p>
<h3><strong>The changes</strong></h3>
<p>Taken straight from the patch notes:</p>
<p>The following champions had their base mana regen adjusted to 6 and mana growth per level changed to 0.8: Ahri, Alistar, Anivia, Annie, Azir, Blitzcrank, Braum, Cassiopeia, Diana, Elise, Fiddlesticks, Fizz, Galio, Gragas, Heimerdinger, Jayce, Karma, Karthus, Kassadin, Kayle, LeBlanc, Leona, Lulu, Lux, Malzahar, Morgana, Nidalee, Orianna, Ryze, Swain, Syndra, Taric, Thresh, Twisted Fate, Veigar, Vel&#8217;koz, Viktor, Xerath, Ziggs, Zilean, Zyra</p>
<p>The following champions had their base mana regen adjusted to 9 and mana growth per level changed to 0.4: Janna, Nami, Sona, and Soraka</p>
<p>Mana regen items were also changed significantly, except for Doran’s Ring, which still gives 3 flat mana regeneration per 5 seconds. The Meditation mastery in the utility tree also went unchanged, giving 1/2/3 mp5. Instead of giving flat mana regen per 5 seconds (mp5), most items now multiply your base mana regen by a %, stacking additively.</p>

<p>Another note to consider, champions’ base stats now index starting at 1, rather than 0. This means that if a champion’s base mp5 and mp5/level went unchanged in 4.20, they still were slightly nerfed by losing out on one “level up” worth of mp5. This happened in a couple of cases, which I’ll discuss below.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Mana Font passive on Chalice, Athene’s Unholy Grail, and Mikael’s Crucible was changed from increasing your mana regen by 1% of every missing mana to restoring 1.5% of your missing mana every 5 seconds. This was later changed to restoring 2% of missing mana every 5 seconds in 4.21.</p>
<p>Now, if you’re like me when you first read those patch notes, you’re probably thinking what does all that actually mean?</p>
<p>That’s what I’m going to break down.</p>
<h3><strong>Champion Base Stats change</strong></h3>
<p>In this section, I’m going to talk about what changed in terms of base stats. Prior to the patch, champions had widely-varying mp5 and mp5/level stats. 4.20 standardized pretty much all of them if you’re a conventional backline support, a mana-using mid, an AP-using jungler, or a tanky support. Mana-using bruisers and fighters (e.g. Jarvan IV, Darius, Nocturne, Vi, Wukong, Pantheon, etc.) were unchanged, as were AD carries.</p>
<p>I’ve graphed the old and new mp5 base stats scaling for each champion. The blue lines show what the champion’s mp5 stat looked like at each level before patch 4.20 and the red lines show the post 4.20 values. The changes were <strong><em>not </em></strong>an across-the-board nerf. Some champions were nerfed early and buffed late. Some champions were just nerfed. And some champions were inexplicably buffed across the board.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a graph for each champion that was changed, but I put a summary at the bottom of the graphs if you&#8217;d rather just scroll through it.</p>

<p>Overall, here’s a shorter breakdown of how champions fared:</p>
<p><strong>Only nerfed: </strong>Braum, Cassiopeia, Galio, Heimerdinger, Janna, Jayce, Karthus, Leona, Swain, Zyra</p>
<p><strong>Nerfed before 10-13: </strong>Elise, Fiddlesticks, Karma, Morgana, Zilean</p>
<p><strong>Nerfed before 7-9, buffed after: </strong>Ahri, Anivia, Annie, Azir, Diana, Kassadin, LeBlanc, Malzahar, Ryze,   Syndra, Veigar, Vel’Koz, Ziggs,</p>
<p><strong>Nerfed before 5-6, buffed after: </strong>Kayle, Nidalee, Orianna, Xerath</p>
<p><strong>Nerfed before 4, buffed after: </strong>Alistar, Blitzcrank, Fizz, Gragas, Lux, Twisted Fate, Viktor</p>
<p><strong>Nerfed LATEGAME: </strong>Nami (level 9), Sona (level 7), Soraka (level 3)</p>
<p><strong>Only buffed: </strong>Lulu, Taric, Thresh</p>
<p>Two other champions worth noting. Talon and Lissandra both fall into the category of mana-using mids, but they weren’t changed. I’m not sure exactly why on either of them, but both of them have less than the new baseline mana regen. Lissandra has 5.67 mp5 and 0.4 per level, and Talon has 7.59 base mp5 and 0.5 mp per level. Lissandra should fare decently, though, because of her passive, and because she was unchanged while a lot of her counters (longer-ranged utility/poke mages) end up weaker after 4.20.</p>
<p>Basically, if you got buffed before or around level 6, your champion got significantly stronger. I’m not sure why Riot made some of these changes, but if you’re wondering why Fizz is now banworthy despite not having any specific changes, he ends up with nearly 40% more mp5 at level 18, and since Fizz doesn’t itemize mp5 beyond Doran’s Rings, the item changes don’t affect him. Speaking of the item changes, let’s talk about those.</p>
<h3><strong>Items Change</strong></h3>
<p>Mana regeneration items saw a big change as well that ties into the champion base stats change. Instead of giving flat mp5, which is admittedly a pretty worthless stat lategame, they multiply a percentage of your base stats. Note that mana regeneration items do <strong>not multiply bonus flat mp5 </strong>from runes, items, or masteries.</p>
<p>Since there’s so many possible item builds across a number of champions, it’s not particularly helpful to graph all builds for all champions. There’s too much variation and you end up with too much noise. Instead, I’m going to construct informative representative cases from popular champions of each type to determine <strong>overall trends. </strong></p>
<p>Let’s look at a tanky support (Thresh), a ranged support (Nami), a utility mage (Orianna), an assassin (Fizz), and a couple of Tear of the Goddess stackers (Jayce and Ryze). Note that for this section, I’m not going to talk about the Mana Font passive on Chalice and its upgrades. That deserves its own section.</p>
<p><strong>Thresh</strong></p>
<p>Thresh, like most other tanky supports like Braum, Leona, or Alistar, doesn’t itemize mp5. His only mp5 item would be a Mikael’s Crucible lategame. Let’s say that Thresh picks up Forbidden Idol at level 13 and then completes Crucible by level 15. I’m not saying this is always going to happen, but it’s a reasonable representative case. Recall that Thresh was buffed (slightly) in terms of base mp5.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ThreshItems.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22326" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ThreshItems.png" alt="ThreshItems" width="526" height="316" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ThreshItems.png 526w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ThreshItems-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, there was very little change in Thresh’s mp5 curve between the two. This would also be true for Braum and Leona. Alistar, Blitzcrank, and especially Taric received considerable buffs to their mp5, so they would be overall <strong>buffed </strong>by the new patch. Tanky supports will be as good or better than they were prior to the 4.20 patch.</p>
<p><strong>Nami</strong></p>
<p>Nami starts with a Spellthief’s Edge and takes the Meditation mastery. She’ll build up to a Frostfang by level 8 and a Frost Queen’s Claim by level 12, since she’s probably prioritizing Sightstone and maybe components of an Aegis. She’ll finish her build with a Crucible by level 15 (in terms of mp5).</p>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/NamiItems.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22309" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/NamiItems.png" alt="NamiItems" width="526" height="316" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/NamiItems.png 526w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/NamiItems-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></a></p>
<p>Nami’s mp5 curve ends up being fairly similar to her old one, with small nerfs lategame. She loses out on the mp5 spike when she completes Frost Queen’s Claim, and her pre-6 mp5 is slightly better, while her lategame isn’t quite as good. Nami and Janna, who had the least changes to their base stats, ended up about as good as they were before, or a little better prior to buying Chalice. Soraka and Sona, who were largely nerfed in their base stats, don’t recover mana as quickly in the lategame, especially with (spoiler alert) the Chalice nerfs.</p>
<p><strong>Orianna</strong></p>
<p>For our scenario, Orianna will start with a Doran’s Ring and the Meditation mastery. She will pick up a Chalice by level 6. She’ll complete Athene’s by level 10 and then not really itemize mana otherwise.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/OriannaItems.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22312" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/OriannaItems.png" alt="OriannaItems" width="526" height="316" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/OriannaItems.png 526w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/OriannaItems-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></a></p>
<p>Orianna’s mana regeneration, excluding the effects of Chalice, is slightly weaker until she reaches lategame. The end result is that Orianna ends up being nerfed until lategame, particularly in the midgame. We can surmise from looking at the base stats graphs that most other Chalice users were also nerfed slightly, so poke and utility mages are more blue-buff dependent and less able to spam. This is likely tied to Riot’s desire to reduce free wave clearing power. Note that Twisted Fate and Xerath, who aren’t necessarily tied to Chalice, will feel stronger since their midgame stats were buffed and they have a separate mana recovery mechanic.</p>
<p><strong>Fizz</strong></p>
<p>Fizz is not taking Meditation or itemizing mana beyond two Doran’s Rings, with the second purchased at level 5. His mp5 looks almost exactly the same until level 6, where he gets increasingly buffed thanks to his base stats change. Running OOM on Fizz should be quite a bit harder, and it makes him less blue buff dependent for mana. He still benefits greatly from blue buff’s CDR. Fizz and probably Akali, Zed, and Katarina (who were completely unaffected by these changes) stand to gain the most out of the assassins. Ahri, LeBlanc, and Diana have slight early-game nerfs to their mp5, but recover and are even buffed by midgame. It’s a good time to be an assassin (although Talon’s mp5 is still pretty horrid).</p>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/FizzItems.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22291" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/FizzItems.png" alt="FizzItems" width="526" height="316" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/FizzItems.png 526w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/FizzItems-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Jayce</strong></p>
<p>Jayce will take Meditation and build Tear of the Goddess by level 5. He’ll complete Muramana by level 10 and otherwise not itemize mana regen.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JayceItems.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22297" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JayceItems.png" alt="JayceItems" width="526" height="316" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JayceItems.png 526w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JayceItems-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></a></p>
<p>As the graph shows, Jayce (and probably most other Manamune champs) was appreciably nerfed since his base mp5 was also nerfed. Other Manamune users like Ezreal have even similar or less mp5 than Jayce.</p>
<p><strong>Ryze</strong></p>
<p>On the AP-side of the Tear of the Goddess builds, Ryze builds Tear of the Goddess by level 5 and finishes an Archangel’s Staff by level 13 since he’s building Rod of Ages also. As you can see, Ryze loses out considerably, and is heavily nerfed in terms of his ability to recover mana. Ryze’s base stats curve is pretty similar to how other tear-stackers like Karthus, Kassadin, Nidalee, and Anivia were changed, so if you’re building Tear of the Goddess on an AP caster, expect to recover less mana from it.</p>

<h3><strong>Chalice</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s talk about Chalice, because it was nerfed, and hard in 4.20, only to regain most of its strength in 4.21. I’m going to use Orianna again, looking at her stats at levels 6, 9, 13, and 18. The old Chalice used to increase your mana regeneration by 1% for every 1% of missing mana. The new Chalice grants you 2% of your missing mana every 5 seconds, which is pretty different. Here’s how the graphs shake out:</p>

<p>You’re seeing the results of an intentional nerf at Chalice users. When you’re missing more than 10% mana, Chalice is less effective at restoring mana in the early game. In the midgame, Chalice ends up being slightly stronger when you’re missing less than 20-25% mana (for all the good that does), but still remains being nerfed fairly significantly at lower mana levels.</p>
<p>Orianna was fairly lucky in terms of her mp5 base stats change and didn’t take too much of a hit, so she just experiences the Chalice changes, which after 4.21 aren’t too severe. Some other champions like Zyra or Galio who really like Chalice were nerfed in base stats for the entire game and had their Chalice build significantly weakened, so they didn’t fare as well.</p>
<h3><strong>Blue buff</strong></h3>
<p>Blue buff’s effect wasn’t changed. It still gives 25 flat mp5 and restores 0.5% of your missing mana per 5 seconds. Its duration was reduced by 30 seconds. Now, here’s the bad news. Because of the Chalice and Tear of the Goddess nerfs, if you wanted blue buff before, you <strong>really </strong>want it now. Defending and controlling blue buff is more important than ever for blue-buff dependent champions</p>
<h3><strong>Competitive Forecast<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>In competitive play, I suspect we’ll see considerably less Chalice-dependent champions, and less Tear of the Goddess play as well. Supports weren’t nerfed too much (and in the case of Blitzcrank, Alistar, Taric, and Lulu buffed), but the mana regen changes will definitely impact midlane.</p>
<p>Expect to see a lot more assassins, particularly of the manaless variety (i.e. Zed if somehow he’s not banned), in mid, along with Xerath and Twisted Fate. We’re already seeing some of this in the OGN Champions Preseason 2015 picks, with Ahri, LeBlanc, Lissandra, and Lulu dominating the midpicks in the few games we’ve seen thus far. While many of their builds include Athene’s, I wouldn’t describe any of those champions except Lulu as particularly dependent on it as a core item, and Lulu’s base mp5 stats were heavily buffed. Some Tear of the Goddess champs were banned out frequently (Jayce is a permaban in competitive play at least through 4.20), but only a pair of Ezreal picks (Faker mid and Zefa ADC) actually built it.</p>
<p>Orianna and Syndra still see picks, both in Korea and at IEM San Jose, with an occasional Kassadin, but aside from that, I wouldn’t expect to see many other Chalice/Tear-dependent champs in mid for the competitive scene. In the Champions Preason and IEM San Jose tournaments on 4.20, we didn’t see a lot of Athene’s built, though with 4.21, the item may make a bit of a comeback. The current competitive mid roster looks like Ahri, Jayce, Katarina, LeBlanc, Lissandra, Lulu, Orianna, Syndra, Zed, and Xerath, with the occasional AD mid (Ezreal or Corki). Of course, this is preseason, so we’ll have to see how things shake out as the pros adapt and as Riot continues to make changes.</p>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>What all this means is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tank supports are the same or buffed</li>
<li>Ranged supports are slightly nerfed</li>
<li>Utility and poke mages are slightly weaker due to mana regen nerfs. Twisted Fate, Lissandra, and Xerath are excluded from this.</li>
<li>Assassins are the same or stronger</li>
<li>Tear of the Goddess builds are now considerably weaker</li>
<li>Chalice builds are now considerably weaker</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Welcome to the Jungle</h1>
<p>Welcome everyone to my analysis of the new jungle that is arriving in season 5. Today I am going to be focusing on a small but important part of jungling, the initial clear. Compared to last season, the new jungle is going to be a little bit slower and quite a bit more punishing. A more expensive machete means fewer potions; while this won’t prevent most standard (and many non-standard) junglers from working, it will make it riskier across the board.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center"> <strong>**Disclaimer**</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Before I begin I just want to put this here. Individual times could easily vary but they should still provide a reasonable place for comparison. In addition, <strong>all clears are done without a leash</strong>. This is done to provide a worst-case scenario and eliminates the variability that comes with leashes. Finally, as this information was gathered on the PBE it is subjective to any last minute changes, but it should be consistent with patch 4.20.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Introducing the New Jungle Paths</h2>
<p>There are two new jungle paths that I am focusing on for this analysis: the<span style="color: #cc082f"> <strong>Krug Path</strong></span> and the <span style="color: #4d07d9"><strong>Gromp Path</strong></span>. These two paths both follow the same pattern, starting by smiting the named small camp to hit level 2, than grabbing both buff camps starting with the closer. The path can be seen below. An immediate smite on either small camp should give it plenty of time to recharge right around your arrival to the second buff camp.</p>
<div id="attachment_22112" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NewSR.jpg"><img class="wp-image-22112 size-large" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NewSR-620x533.jpg" alt="NewSR" width="620" height="533" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NewSR-620x533.jpg 620w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NewSR-300x258.jpg 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NewSR.jpg 1333w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The red line highlights the Krug Path and the blue line highlights the Gromp Path. Camps where smite should be used are circled.</p></div>
<p>There are a couple of reasons behind my choosing of these paths.</p>
<ul>
<li>First off, frankly they are new and therefore more interesting to analyze than a Buff-&gt;Camp-&gt;Buff route.</li>
<li>Second, the only major difference is getting your first buff sooner, which may or may not be a benefit given the increased difficulty of early ganking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, because smiting red and blue only give health and mana respectively, you are probably not getting the full benefit out of your first smite bonus. Whether these new routes truly will be the best I cannot say, it may in fact vary from champion to champion, but I believe they are highly worth considering.</p>
<p>The major difference between the two jungle paths is a trade off of speed for sustain. In all cases, the Gromp path proved to be the faster of the two routes, although by how much varied from champion to champion. The <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Gromp">Gift of the Toadstool</a></span> passive deals a good amount of bonus damage, especially for champions that lack strong AoE abilities. On the other hand the Krug path tends to be the safer path thanks to the stun effect from <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ancient_Krug">Gift of Heavy Hands</a></span>, with tanky champions such as Amumu being notable exceptions.</p>
<h2>Reading the Graphs</h2>
<p>Displayed below are graphs detailing the time at which each champion reaches level 3, which occurs after clearing the second buff camp. Because<strong> sustain is very important in the early minutes of jungling</strong>, in addition to speed I have also placed each champion into a risk category based on their remaining health. Now I will be the first to admit these ranks are somewhat subjective and they are not a perfect account, but I tried to be as objective as possible when making these categories.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff">Low Risk</span> –</strong> Low risk champions can generally make it to level 3 with a strong health pool, no less than 60% hp remaining. They should have no problem taking another camp or even attempting a gank without much risk of giving away an easy kill.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ffcc00">Average Risk</span> –</strong> These champions clear level 3 with around 50% hp remaining. They generally should be able to manage another camp, although some champions will naturally be riskier than others. They may even be able to gank, although it will definitely carry the risk of giving away a kill.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000">High Risk</span> –</strong> These champions should probably be heading back to base immediately. They end with low health, no more than 40%, and often are only a few hits away from death. Whether they can survive clearing the next camp will vary from champion to champion but either way you would be easy pickings for an invader. Ganking at this point would likely be suicidal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Notes</h5>
<p>Now you may notice a small handful of champions who are conspicuously missing from the lists.</p>
<p><strong>Alistar &#8211;</strong> His major flaw in this analysis is that he is slow as molasses. Sure he has great sustain, but in both routes he is a full 10 seconds slower than the next slowest champion. To put it another way, many of the faster champions could be buying their first item by the time Alistar reaches his second buff. That being said, there may be hope for the jungle cow yet; given the fact that early ganks are likely to diminish he may actually succeed in filling a niche roll by killing a single camp and immediately ganking at level 2.</p>
<p><strong>Evelynn and Wukong –</strong> These guys don’t make the list because without a leash they don’t survive the clears, which means they will be forced into less efficient routes or simply need to return to base at level 2. They are too squishy and lack shields or sustain to make up for it. Other less common junglers who fall into this same position are <strong>Blitzcrank</strong>, <strong>Gnar</strong> and <strong>Zed</strong>.</p>
<p>The raw data table for the graphs can be found at the end of the article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Proponents of Change</h2>
<p>Below I would like to highlight some of the champions that seem to be benefiting well from the new jungle changes. Obviously <strong>none of these champions are guaranteed to make a splash</strong>, it takes far more than just an initial clear to make a jungler tick, but their <strong>early advantages seem to indicate a higher potential</strong> for jungle prowess. Naturally there are other champions who do well in the new jungle, perhaps even better that those listed, but these the ones that I think stand out in terms of <strong>both speed and sustain</strong>.</p>
<h3>Speed Demons</h3>
<p>These junglers are the ones who can really power through the jungle at a breakneck pace. Probably more important is their ability to stay healthy while doing it. The all have natural synergy with the Krug passive and the shields or heals to make Gromp’s passive work, giving them an added layer of versatility that should make their start more unpredictable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/55px-DianaSquare.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22159" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/55px-DianaSquare.png" alt="55px-DianaSquare" width="55" height="55" /></a></strong></p>

<p>Diana looks to start out strong in season 5 thanks to her powerful AoE spells and a shield to keep her health up. She is an extremely fast clearer, one of the best, and is especially notable because she may be the best speed demon at applying lane pressure right after her first clear, rather than just focusing on the jungle. She clear the jungle with <span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>Low</strong></span> to <span style="color: #ffcc00"><strong>Average</strong></span> risk, depending on which path she takes.</p>

<p>Nocturne hits the jungle hard and fast, with his passive giving him the AoE and sustain needed to stick around far more effectively than other squishy junglers. Nocturne is the most vulnerable of those listed here, having <span style="color: #ffcc00"><strong>Average</strong></span> to <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>High</strong></span> risk depending on the path, but this will really only prevent him from attempting ganks he doesn&#8217;t want to do anyway. He has always been a potent level 6 ganker and a solid start should set him up for that quite nicely.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/55px-SkarnerSquare.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="color: #cc082f">3:14 Krug</span> | <span style="color: #4d07d9">3:06 Gromp</span></strong></p>
<p>Skarner is another jungler who seems poised to have a breakout season. He is very similar to Nocturne, being someone who likes to power through to level 6, and thanks to his built in shield and stun he should have no problem doing so. Skarner clears the two paths with <span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>Low</strong></span> to <span style="color: #ffcc00"><strong>Average</strong></span> risk, and thanks to his CC abilities he can put out respectable lane pressure as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><img class="aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/55px-MasterYiSquare.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" /></strong> <strong>– Honorable Mention –</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="color: #cc082f">3:07 Krug</span> | <span style="color: #4d07d9">3:00 Gromp</span></strong></p>
<p>It would be unfair to talk about speed demons without mentioning the king of clear speed, Master Yi. Honestly he hasn&#8217;t really changed much; he still rips through the jungle faster than anyone, albeit with some more risk than he is used too. Yi fills the same role he always has, and even a bit more risk is not going to change much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Sustain Titans</h3>
<p>This group of junglers should really come as no surprise, considering how valuable sustain is, and while not quite as fast as the speed demons they are all able to hold their own with above average clear times. Their incredible natural sustain allows them to clear both <span style="color: #cc082f"><strong>Krug</strong></span> and <span style="color: #4d07d9"><strong>Gromp</strong></span> path with <span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>Low Risk</strong></span>; in many cases not even relying on potions to get the job done. This makes them versatile, and unlike the speed demons they are probably going to do more than focus on clearing their own jungle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="alignnone" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/55px-OlafSquare.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="color: #cc082f">3:12 Krug</span> | <span style="color: #4d07d9">3:05 Gromp</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Olaf really stands out among high sustain champions with his ability to clear the jungle at an absolutely breakneck pace, rivaling the speed demons listed above. To do so though requires a lot of finesse thanks to the way his passive and W abilities work. It actually requires you to be very conservative with potions, allowing Olaf to fall to dangerously low health in order to increase speed. This does make him <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>High Risk</strong></span> mid clear and should be done with caution, but it pays off in the long run and allows him to recover into a very comfortable position without sacrificing speed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="alignnone" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/55px-EliseSquare.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="color: #cc082f">3:20 Krug</span> | <span style="color: #4d07d9">3:10 Gromp</span></strong></p>
<p>Elise has always been good at surviving the jungle thanks to her natural sustain and <span style="color: #000000">ability</span> to juggle monster agro with her spiderlings, a trait which seems more important than ever. Although she is more potion reliant than the other junglers in this group, her ability to have a very strong and safe ganking presence at level 3 makes her stand out.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="alignnone" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/55px-NunuSquare.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="color: #cc082f">3:17 Krug</span> | <span style="color: #4d07d9">3:09 Gromp</span></strong></p>
<p>A classic control jungler, Nunu could once again resurface thanks to his ability to directly pressure the opponent jungler and make their life difficult. His most noteworthy trait is his ability to get through the jungle without potions when starting from Gromp, allowing him a (mostly) unique ability to <strong>start with a ward</strong>, opening up all sorts of avenues for play especially in the competitive scene.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><img class="alignnone" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/55px-FiddlesticksSquare.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" /><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="color: #cc082f">3:20 Krug</span> | <span style="color: #4d07d9">3:10 Gromp</span></strong></p>
<p>Fiddlesticks is naturally a very well sustained champion and, like Nunu, has the ability to <strong>start with a ward</strong> rather than potions no matter where he starts in the jungle. To top it off his drain makes him very dangerous duelist against anyone who cannot knock him out of it. These strengths should make him a potent threat in the new jungle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="alignnone" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/55px-WarwickSquare.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" /><br />
<strong>– Honorable Mention –</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="color: #cc082f">3:34 Krug</span> | <span style="color: #4d07d9">3:19 Gromp</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Like the rest of the champions on this list, Warwick has extremely high natural sustain and doesn&#8217;t need potions to keep his health up. Where he really suffers is from his very slow clear speeds, among the slowest of any potential junglers. This leaves him vulnerable to simply having his jungle snatched out from under him by the myriad of quicker champions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Enemies of Change</h2>
<p>While some champions seem to really benefit from the changes, others are far more adversely affected. While everyone is at a bit more risk in the new jungle, these champions really stand out. This by no means spells an end to these champions ability to function as junglers, but it certainly makes them far more risky. The champions here are always at a <span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>High Risk</strong></span>, or worse, when following either jungle path.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="alignnone" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/55px-KhaZixSquare.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="color: #cc082f">3:22 Krug</span> |<span style="color: #4d07d9"> 3:13 Gromp</span></strong></p>
<p>Kha&#8217;Zix, ironically, falls on this list. He is receiving a small but significant 2s nerf to his W cooldown. Fewer Void Spikes means less speed and sustain on a champion that was already feeling the pain in the new jungle. With poor sustain and above average clear times, Kha’Zix probably won’t be applying early pressure anytime soon, so his advantages will have to come solely from the new item changes if he wants to stay relevant.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="alignnone" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/55px-LeeSinSquare.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="color: #cc082f">3:11 Krug</span> | <span style="color: #4d07d9">3:06 Gromp</span></strong></p>
<p>Like Kha’Zix, Lee was already hurting from the changes and upcoming armor nerfs will put him into an even riskier position. However he still maintains clear speeds on par with the speed demons, so he will likely have a much easier time sticking with the meta than everyone’s favorite void mantis. Considering his extreme versatility and popularity, it is unlikely he will ever fall out of favor completely, but hopefully he will become less oppressive towards other champions.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that by taking W second instead of E, you can sustain much better and it takes a lot of the risk out. It does however cost a lot of time, ~10s in both directions. Whether one skill will end up better than the other I cannot say, but either way it looks like Lee will be much less dominant than he was last season.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/55px-EvelynnSquare.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" /><img class="aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/55px-WukongSquare.png" alt="" width="55" height="55" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>Death Risk</strong></span></p>
<p>As I mentioned before, these two are especially notable because they haven’t even made my lists. They are simply too squishy and lack the natural sustain needed to survive early on. Now granted a good leash could make all the difference, but the extreme vulnerability of their early clears may make it far more difficult to justify choosing them over other junglers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>So it seems like the season 5 jungle will be a very new place, especially during the very early stages of the game. It is certainly a much more dangerous place and this is advantageous to champions who can survive well. However with so many new changes to itemization, it is impossible to say who will or will not come out on top and we can only hope that jungling becomes a more interesting a varied place to play.</p>

<h6>Below you can see the raw data table that I used for the charts. The runes listed are formatted as (Reds+Quints) and the rest of the pages are all filled with 9 armor yellows and 5% CDR + Mr blues. Rune pages and masteries are based on what I could find from pros, although they are not customized for individual champions.</h6>
<h6>So for example, all AD focused champions, whether using an (AD+AD) or (AD+AS) page, use the same 21/9/0 page.</h6>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello, friends! It&#8217;s been a while since my last article, but today I&#8217;m going to be going over a pretty robust collection of changes that the PBE has experienced over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>As always, PBE content is subject to change, but that goes double this time around: A lot of the changes that I&#8217;ll be talking about today are preseason changes. While I live in hope, I have no idea if these will be out in patch 4.20, or if not how soon we will see them. Riot has put out a few excellent dev blogs about <strong><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/preseason-2015-increasing-strategic-diversity">Strategic Diversity</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/preseason-2015-diversifying-objectives">Objective Changes</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/preseason-2015-new-jungle">the New Jungle</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/preseason-2015-forging-diverse-armory">Itemisation Changes</a></strong>, so I&#8217;d recommend checking those out. Also, the numbers on preseason changes are definitely changeable.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll try my best to split this article into normal balance stuff and preseason stuff, but it&#8217;s not exactly apparent what falls into which category, so don&#8217;t be surprised if I&#8217;m wrong. At any rate, let&#8217;s take a look at what&#8217;s going on this cycle!</p>
<h3>Preseason Changes</h3>
<h4>Jungle</h4>
<p>A few things are changing in the jungle this season. Jungle items are receiving an overhaul, new incentives and mini-objectives are being placed in the jungle, and there are a few tuning changes to the jungle itself. First of all, Smite&#8217;s cooldown has been pushed back up to 1 minute, from the 40 seconds that it is on live.</p>
<p>The health on jungle monsters has been buffed, so it&#8217;s much harder to take them down now. Mid laners who want to take wraiths (or Raptors as they are now) will have a much harder time of it nowadays. To compensate, though, the experience and gold rewards from the jungle have been increased.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a chart of some sample gold rewards from the non-buff monsters in the jungle on live as compared to preseason. As you can see, wraiths in particular have become quite a bit more lucrative. Keep in mind that the new jungle items don&#8217;t generate any gold, so what you see is what you get.</p>

<p>Also, each large monster now gives a unique reward in the form of a buff that is granted upon smiting the monster in question, which gives junglers some more interesting objectives to fight over.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img class="size-full wp-image-22055 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Hunters_Machete_item.png" alt="Hunter's_Machete_item" width="64" height="64" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Hunter&#8217;s Machete</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Jungle items have recieved quite the overhaul in this preseason patch. All four of season 4&#8217;s jungle items have been scrapped in favour of a more diverse approach to jungle itemisation. Hunter&#8217;s Machete now costs 400 gold (up from 325) and instead of giving +10 AD and +5 damage reduction vs. monsters, places a damage-over-time effect on the opponent and gives you some regen.</p>
<p>Attacks place a DoT that does 30 magic damage over 2 seconds, and being in combat with monsters causes you to gain 8 health and 3 mana per second. This is good news for tank junglers and junglers with low attack speeds, who no longer have to rely on faster autoattacks to clear.</p>
<p>Machete still upgrades into 4 items, but they are items of a very different flavour than the spirit stones and madred&#8217;s razors that we&#8217;re all used to. Rather than focusing on preferred stats, the upgrades to Machete (which cost 350 gold each) upgrade the machete&#8217;s stats to 45 magic damage over 2 seconds and 10 health and 5 mana per second, as well as changing your summoner smite spell to have a new effect depending on the role you wish to take as jungler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Stalkers_Blade.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-22057 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Stalkers_Blade.png" alt="Stalkers_Blade" width="64" height="64" /></a>Stalker&#8217;s Blade</strong></p>
<p><strong>Passive- Chilling Smite:</strong> Smite can be cast on enemy champions, dealing reduced true damage and reducing their movement speed by 50% for 2 seconds.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Stalker&#8217;s Blade</strong> is the item you&#8217;ll want to pick up if you&#8217;re going to be focused on heavy ganking, especially when playing a champion that lacks CC. The slow is very helpful for closing on slippery opponents when coming out of the bush, and it&#8217;s only on a 1-minute cooldown. The damage on it isn&#8217;t huge (it&#8217;s about 7-8% of the total damage of smite), but it&#8217;s something. The slow is what you&#8217;re going for, though.</p>
<p>Junglers that want to spend a lot of time in the lanes will want to pick this up. Champions like Wukong and Skarner benefit from the slow as it helps them get in close and personal. The drawback to this item, though, is that you&#8217;ll want to be saving the slow for ganks, so you won&#8217;t really have a smite to clear with. If your ganks are successful, however, the lower farm will be made up for. Just make sure you save smite for dragon attempts.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Poachers_Knife.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-22058 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Poachers_Knife.png" alt="Poachers_Knife" width="64" height="64" /></a>Poacher&#8217;s Knife</strong></p>
<p><strong>Passive- Scavenging Smite: </strong>When you Smite and kill a large monster in the enemy jungle, the cooldown of Smite is halved, you gain +20 bonus gold, and you gain 175% increased movement speed decaying over 2 seconds.</p>
<hr />
<p>Counterjungling makes a comeback! <strong>Poacher&#8217;s Knife</strong> is your  go-to choice if you plan on sneaking into your enemy&#8217;s jungle and taking their stuff. The stats on this bad boy support a style more focused on taking your enemy&#8217;s gold and then running for the hills; the movement speed buff makes it very easy to escape with your ill-gotten gains.</p>
<p>Control-based counterjunglers like Udyr and Nunu will have a great time with this item, as the extra gold and lower cooldown on smite will enable them to put their enemy behind and make up for the energy they put into leaving your jungle. You&#8217;ll also be stealing your opponent&#8217;s smite buffs, which are now on every large jungle monster (more on that later). The main disadvantage to this item is that if your opponent sees it in your inventory, they&#8217;ll be on guard for invades and likely ward up their jungle more than they normally would.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Rangers_Trailblazer.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-22059 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Rangers_Trailblazer.png" alt="Rangers_Trailblazer" width="64" height="64" /></a>Ranger&#8217;s Trailblazer</strong></p>
<p><strong>Passive- Blasting Smite: </strong>The cooldown of Smite is reduced by 15 seconds. Smite also deals half damage to all monsters and enemy minions near the target and stuns them for 1.5 seconds. Casting Smite on a monster restores 15% of missing Health and Mana.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Ranger&#8217;s Trailblazer</strong> is the farming item for season 5. The AoE smite helps clear out jungle camps very quickly, the reduced cooldown helps not only your clear speed but also gets you more Smite buffs, and the health and mana restoration really help keep you up in the new jungle (which is significantly more punishing than the old one). It can also help when pushing lanes, as the splash-Smite works on normal minions as well as jungle camps.</p>
<p>Farming champions like Master Yi and Warwick (sometimes) will enjoy this item. Not only does it make your jungle-clearing more efficient, but it actually frees you up to gank a bit even if you want to spend most of your time in the jungle, Hopefully we won&#8217;t get too many Yi jungles who stay in the jungle for 20 minutes while the lanes feed to the enemy team&#8217;s pressure. The only downside to this item is that your enemy will definitely out-gank you.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center"><b><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Skirmishers_sabre.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-22060 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Skirmishers_sabre.png" alt="Skirmishers_sabre" width="64" height="64" /></a>Skirmisher&#8217;s Sabre</b></p>
<p><strong>Passive- Challenging Smite: </strong>Smite can be cast on enemy champions, marking them for 6 seconds. While marked, you deal bonus true damage to them on hit, have vision of them, and reduce their damage to you by 20%.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Skirmisher&#8217;s Sabre</strong> is perhaps the most radical of the jungle items in season 5. While the other ones focus on ganking, counterjungling and farming (all of which are established jungle tactics), Sabre&#8217;s focus is on invading the enemy jungle, specifically with the intent to duel your jungle opponent on their own turf, which isn&#8217;t done too often at the moment.</p>
<p>Characters with high duel potential like Lee Sin and Nocturne might consider picking up the Sabre. The bonus true damage isn&#8217;t incredibly high (about 4-5% of the damage of Smite), but the 20% reduced damage will pretty much guarantee you winning a duel if all else is equal. The Sabre has limited effectiveness in ganks since it does nothing for your laner, but someone who already has plenty of CC like Nautilus or Sejuani may consider picking it up if they&#8217;re feeling ballsy.</p>
<p><strong>Enchantments</strong></p>
<p>Each of the four items that I&#8217;ve listed can upgrade in four different stat-related directions to make them worth the item slot. The upgrades function in a similar way to the upgrades on boots. The four items, times four upgrades, gives us sixteen possible choices of jungle item slot, which makes me really excited for the potential diversity of build paths for junglers this season.</p>
<p>The enchantments each involve a bit of buildup and a recipe cost, totaling 2250 gold (or an extra 1500 if you already have your machete upgrade). The four upgrades are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enchantment: Warrior </strong>
<ul>
<li>+45 Attack Damage</li>
<li>+10% CDR</li>
<li>+10 Armour Penetration</li>
<li>Builds from upgraded Machete and Brutaliser</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Enchantment: Magus</strong>
<ul>
<li>+80 Ability Power</li>
<li>+20% CDR</li>
<li>Builds from upgraded Machete and Fiendish Codex</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Enchantment: Juggernaut</strong>
<ul>
<li>+500 Health</li>
<li>+10% CDR</li>
<li>Unique Passive- Tenacity: Reduced duration of stuns, slows, taunts, fears, silences, blinds, polymorphs and immobilises by 35%</li>
<li>Builds from upgraded Machete, Ruby Crystal and Kindlegem</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Enchantment: Devourer</strong>
<ul>
<li>+50% Attack Speed</li>
<li>+40 Magic Damage on hit</li>
<li>Unique Passive- Devouring: Killing large monsters increases the magic damage of this item by +1. Champion kills or assists increase the magic damage of this item by +2.</li>
<li>Builds from upgraded Machete and two Daggers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The four enchantments are made for AD Casters, AP Mages, Tanks and Attack Speed champions respectively. You may have noticed the glorious return of Tenacity on the Juggernaut enchantment, which will take champions like Nautilus back to their golden days of being able to buy Mobility Boots.</p>
<p>The Devourer enchantment is also noteworthy for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it stacks up damage based on farm and kills / assists a la Feral Flare. This definitely supports an attack-speed carry sort of playstyle, but the item doesn&#8217;t have AD or AP on it, so AD-AS characters and AS-AP hybrids will have equally good times with it.</p>
<p>The sixteen combinations of jungle items represent a pretty radical shift in itemisation for junglers, and will hopefully yield a lot more diversity in build paths. Now that we&#8217;ve covered them, let&#8217;s take a look at the biggest change to jungle objectives in season 5; Smite Rewards.</p>
<hr />
<h5 style="text-align: center"><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Smite.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-22056 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Smite.png" alt="Smite" width="64" height="64" /></a>Smite Rewards</h5>
<hr />
<p>Season 5&#8217;s jungle camps all give specialised rewards when their large monster is smited. These rewards give a nice amount of depth to the smaller jungle camps, as they each have an individual benefit rather than just giving gold. The reward replenishes when the monster respawns, which means if you smite a monster without killing it, the reward won&#8217;t come back.</p>
<p>The rewards are as follows:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GrompSquare.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-22062" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GrompSquare.png" alt="GrompSquare" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GrompSquare.png 128w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GrompSquare-75x75.png 75w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GrompSquare-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a>Gromp (Wight):</strong> Gift of the Toadstool: <span style="text-decoration: underline">Attackers are poisoned for magic damage over 3 seconds</span></p>
<p>The Gromp gives a buff that does damage over time to attacking players. This can really help with your clear speeds, or with combat with other players (particularly for tanky characters).</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blue_SentinelSquare.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-22064" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blue_SentinelSquare.png" alt="Blue_SentinelSquare" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blue_SentinelSquare.png 128w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blue_SentinelSquare-75x75.png 75w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blue_SentinelSquare-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a>Blue Sentinel (Ancient Golem): </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Restores the player&#8217;s mana upon smiting</span></p>
<p>The Sentinel gives you back some mana if you smite it. This isn&#8217;t terribly exciting, since it also gives Blue Buff, but it does help out junglers who hurt their mana pools when giving blue up to their midlaner. Just smite before Sentinel&#8217;s in death-range and you&#8217;ll get some of your mana back.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/MurkwolfSquare.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-22065" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/MurkwolfSquare.png" alt="MurkwolfSquare" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/MurkwolfSquare.png 128w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/MurkwolfSquare-75x75.png 75w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/MurkwolfSquare-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a>Murkwolves (wolves):</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Releases a floating wisp that sits at the junction between Wolves and Blue Buff for 90 seconds which grants vision and chases nearby enemies</span></p>
<p>The Murkwolves don&#8217;t give a buff; rather, they cause a wisp to sit in your jungle and warn you if people come in. This can be pretty handy against counter-jungling opponents to dissuade them from invading or to punish them for sticking around. The wisp lasts 90 seconds, the same length of a pre-9 ward trinket.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Elder_RazorbeakSquare.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-22066" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Elder_RazorbeakSquare.png" alt="Elder_RazorbeakSquare" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Elder_RazorbeakSquare.png 128w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Elder_RazorbeakSquare-75x75.png 75w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Elder_RazorbeakSquare-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a>Raptors (Wraiths):</strong> Razor Sharp: <span style="text-decoration: underline">If spotted by an enemy ward, this unit will be alerted and given magical sight</span></p>
<p>This buff is super-useful if you&#8217;re planning on ganking. It pretty much gives you a replacement red trinket; if you walk by a ward, you&#8217;ll get a nofication and you&#8217;ll be able to see wards for a few seconds. This is great for clearing out a ward before you come back to gank, or just to apply some pressure to a lane.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Red_BramblebackSquare.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-22067" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Red_BramblebackSquare.png" alt="Red_BramblebackSquare" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Red_BramblebackSquare.png 128w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Red_BramblebackSquare-75x75.png 75w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Red_BramblebackSquare-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a>Red Brambleback (Ancient Lizard): </b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Restores the player&#8217;s health upon smiting</span></p>
<p>This one isn&#8217;t too interesting either, but it can be handy for sustaining in the jungle, especially since the Brambleback and his Cinderling minions do a fair amount of damage.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/KrugSquare.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-22063" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/KrugSquare.png" alt="KrugSquare" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/KrugSquare.png 128w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/KrugSquare-75x75.png 75w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/KrugSquare-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a>Krugs (Golems):</strong> Gift of Heavy Hands: <span style="text-decoration: underline">Your first attack and every fifth attack after stuns monsters and minions. Attacking a tower inflicts bonus true damage and consumes the gift of heavy hands</span></p>
<p>This buff has pretty interesting applications. The stun only affects monsters and minions, so it&#8217;s only really useful for taking less damage while farming the jungle. However, the extra damage to towers could be pretty useful if you have the opportunity to push an enemy out of lane.</p>
<h5><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Rift_ScuttlerSquare.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-22068" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Rift_ScuttlerSquare.png" alt="Rift_ScuttlerSquare" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Rift_ScuttlerSquare.png 256w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Rift_ScuttlerSquare-150x150.png 150w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Rift_ScuttlerSquare-75x75.png 75w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Rift_ScuttlerSquare-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a>Scuttle Crab</h5>
<p>The Rift Scuttler (a.k.a. the scuttle crab) is a new monster in season 5. It doesn&#8217;t reside in either team&#8217;s jungle; rather, it scuttles (as its name implies) up and down the river. There are two crabs (one for each side of the river), and they will run away from you if you attack them.</p>
<p>Killing the crab will give you 35 gold at any point during the game, which isn&#8217;t much, but it will also cause it to burrow under the ground and give your team a 90-second ward at the entrance to Dragon or Baron pit. The crab&#8217;s health scales up with level, so you need to commit more and more to fighting it the longer the game goes.</p>
<p>The vision it grants is very helpful, as it prevents the need for warding outside of Baron and Dragon pits. To my knowledge, the vision is not sweepable either, so it&#8217;ll be tough for your opponents to sneak by it. However, it&#8217;s not too oppressive as the vision covers outside the pits but doesn&#8217;t actually extend into the pits themselves.</p>
<h4>Objective Changes</h4>
<p>A few objectives are being given differing rewards to what we&#8217;re used to. The objective is to make differing objectives contribute differently towards different goals. Your preference for objective may depend on your team&#8217;s strategy; for instance, there may be situations in which a dragon is preferable to a baron. I have less specific patch notes on these things, but I&#8217;ll do my best to give a breakdown of the info in the <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/preseason-2015-diversifying-objectives">dev blog</a>.</p>
<h5>Turrets</h5>
<p>Outer and Nexus turrets are unchanged, but inner turrets and inhibitor turrets have received some changes to try and tone down the power of certain comps.</p>
<p><b>Nexus Turrets: </b>Now have a 200-health shield that regenerates after 30 seconds. Nearby friendly champions receive a shield that stacks up 30 health per second up to a total of 300 health, which then decays over 2 seconds after leaving the tower&#8217;s range.</p>
<p><strong>Inhibitor Turrets: </strong>Instead of firing standard shots, inhibitor turrets fire a steady beam that does damage, slows the target, and reduces their damage dealt.</p>
<p>The changes to Nexus turrets should make it so that the early-siege kinds of teams will have a harder time pushing middle lane oppressively, since both the turret and the enemy team is protected. The inhibitor turret change is more aimed at diving, since the reduced damage and slow on the inhibitor turret&#8217;s laser will make diving much more risky.</p>
<p>In general, these changes should lower the power of these kinds of comps and open up more room for counterplay against heavy siege and dive comps, but not nerf them to the point where they don&#8217;t work anymore.</p>
<h5>Dragon</h5>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22091 size-medium" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Dragon-300x186.jpg" alt="Dragon" width="300" height="186" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Dragon-300x186.jpg 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Dragon-620x384.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Dragon has been changed pretty significantly. It no longer gives any global gold to the team (although last-hitting it is still worth 25g). Instead, it gives everyone on your team a permanent buff called Dragon Slayer which gives extra stats as it stacks up.</p>
<p>The buff stacks up to 4 permanent stacks. For every dragon your team manages to kill after the fourth one, your team will get a buff for 3 minutes called Aspect of the Dragon, doubling all of your dragon-based bonuses and causing your auto-attacks to burn enemies for true damage.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a catch, however. For every stack of Dragon Slayer that you have, the dragon itself does an extra 20% damage to you, and takes 7% less damage from you. This makes it much riskier for a team to go after those higher-tier rewards. This is a good move on riot&#8217;s part, since the aspect of the dragon buff could be as strong as a baron buff to certain teams.</p>
<p><strong>Buff: Dragon Slayer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 stack- Dragon&#8217;s Might:</strong> Gives teamwide +8% AD and AP</li>
<li><strong>2 stacks- Dragon&#8217;s Dominance:</strong> +15% damage to minions and monsters</li>
<li><strong>3 stacks- Dragon&#8217;s Flight:</strong> +5% movement speed</li>
<li><strong>4 stacks- Dragon&#8217;s Wrath:</strong> +15% damage to Towers and Buildings</li>
<li><strong>5+ stacks- Aspect of the Dragon:</strong> Doubles other bonuses and your attacks burn enemies for 150 true damage over 3 seconds. Lasts 180 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Baron Nashor</h5>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22090 size-medium" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Baron-Nashor-300x225.jpg" alt="Baron Nashor" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Baron-Nashor-300x225.jpg 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Baron-Nashor-620x465.jpg 620w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Baron-Nashor.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Baron&#8217;s had a bit of makeover as well. He&#8217;s now much more focused on smashing the enemy&#8217;s base defense, which has always been his main purpose but is now much more clear from the buff.</p>
<p>The health and mana regen have been stripped from the buff, and have been replaced by an enhanced recall and a minion empowering aura. This will make the buff a lot less helpful for teams trying to stall out their enemy, but a lot better for teams trying to push hard into the enemy base.</p>
<p>The recall buff makes recall times much shorter, which helps teams regroup and prepare for plays after getting the buff. The minion buff makes minions near champions with the Baron Buff more powerful; Melee minions get tankier, caster minions do more damage, and cannon minions get increased range.</p>
<p>These changes might seem counter-intuitive to the goals behind the changes to the inner turrets, which were, after all, intended to nerf early sieging. However, Baron&#8217;s spawn time has been pushed from 15 minutes to 20 minutes, so the daring super-early baron strat is not a potential reality. Thank god. Plus, the beast does a bit more damage and has some more interesting attack patterns now, so be on your toes.</p>
<h4>Itemisation Changes</h4>
<h5>Elixirs</h5>
<p>The old red and blue elixirs have been scrapped and replaced with more specialised buffs. They now cost 400g each, but are mutually exclusive. Each of the elixirs lasts 3 minutes, as before.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Elixir_of_Ruin_item.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-22074 size-full" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Elixir_of_Ruin_item.png" alt="Elixir_of_Ruin_item" width="64" height="64" /></a>Elixir of Ruin</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">250 Health</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">15% bonus damage to towers</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">Nearby minions gain 15% bonus damage to towers and gain movement speed based on character&#8217;s movement speed.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Elixir_of_Iron_item.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-22073" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Elixir_of_Iron_item.png" alt="Elixir_of_Iron_item" width="64" height="64" /></a>Elixir of Iron</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">25% increased size</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">Slow resistance</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">Tenacity</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">Moving leaves a path behind that boosts allied champions&#8217; movement speed by 15%</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Elixir_of_Sorcery_item.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-22076" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Elixir_of_Sorcery_item.png" alt="Elixir_of_Sorcery_item" width="64" height="64" /></a>Elixir of Sorcery</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">40 Ability power</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">15 bonus mp5</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">Damaging a champion or tower deals 25 bonus true damage. This effect  has a 5-second cooldown against champions but no cooldown against towers.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Elixir_of_Wrath_item.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-22075" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Elixir_of_Wrath_item.png" alt="Elixir_of_Wrath_item" width="64" height="64" /></a>Elixir of Wrath</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">25 Attack damage</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">Dealing physical damage to champions heals for 10% of the damage dealt. Scoring a kill or assist increases the duration of this flask by 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Elixirs are always situational, since they only last 3 minutes. You&#8217;re going to want to pick these up for specific goals; Ruin for killing towers, Iron to initiate teamfights, and Sorcery and Wrath to boost your damage. Since these elixirs are mutually exclusive, you&#8217;ll have to make good decisions when picking which one to buy.</p>
<h5>Chain Vest and Negatron Cloak</h5>
<p>Buying armour and magic resistance at early stages of the game can have its pros and cons. If you want to buy early resistances, you want to pick up a cloth armour or a null-magic mantle since they&#8217;re the cheaper options for resistances. Unfortunately, your build paths out of both of those items are pretty limited. Null-magic mantle in particular doesn&#8217;t build into any of the three heavy MR items (banshee&#8217;s veil, spirit visage and locket of the iron solari).</p>
<p>Riot is solving this issue in season 5 by making Chain Vest actually build out of Cloth Armour, and removing Negatron Cloak from the game entirely. NMM costs 100 extra gold and has 5 extra MR, so it&#8217;s just as gold efficient as it was before. All of the recipes involving Negatron Cloak have been updated so that the later items all cost the same amount, but buying early MR is much more convenient now.</p>
<h5>Regen</h5>
<p>Health and Mana regen are both being changed to be percentage-based values instead of flat values on all regen items. This change will make regeneration items capable of a lot more late-game power, since flat values have the problem of being good early but falling off later. This will hopefully make it so that regen-based builds are a little more viable, which will be a boon to health-stacking tanks like Sejuani and Mundo.</p>
<h5>New Items</h5>
<p>There are a few new items coming to the rift in season 5 as well. There are one or two more items that I know of that are still in the works and haven&#8217;t seen the light of day yet, so we might see more than just these three in the future, but these are the ones that we know of for sure.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Crystalline_Bracer_item.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-22083" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Crystalline_Bracer_item.png" alt="Crystalline_Bracer_item" width="64" height="64" /></a>Crystalline Bracer</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">+200 Health</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">+50% base health regen</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">Builds from Ruby Crystal + Rejuvenation Bead + 20g, for a total of 600g.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">Builds into Righteous Glory and Warmog&#8217;s Armour (Warmogs builds out of 2 crystalline bracers and a giant&#8217;s belt).</p>
<p>Bracer is a nice early-game regen item for regen-based tanks (and possibly supports) that builds into Warmog&#8217;s armour and the new top-tier item, Righteous Glory. There&#8217;s not much to say about it other than that it&#8217;s basically a slightly better ruby crystal. It&#8217;ll probably be pretty great as an early purchase for certain tanky top-laners. Garen in particular will enjoy it, since his passive will go nicely with all this regen itemisation.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Raptor_Cloak_item.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-22082" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Raptor_Cloak_item.png" alt="Raptor_Cloak_item" width="64" height="64" /></a>Raptor Cloak</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">+30 Armour</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">+100% base health regen</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><strong>Unique passive- Point Runner:</strong> Builds up to +30% movement speed over 2 seconds while near turrets.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">Builds from Rejuvenation bead + Cloth armour + 520g for a total of 1000g</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">Builds into Ohmwrecker</p>
<p>Raptor cloak is an interesting item that seems to be intended for split-pushers and siegers, or in some cases for defending towers. Its unique passive gives you movement speed when you&#8217;re around towers, which will make it easier to maneuver under towers or between them. It builds into the redesigned Ohmwrecker, which I&#8217;ll get into in a bit.</p>
<p>Raptor Cloak was also intended to build into one of the items that&#8217;s still in development, which is a pushing item that can open portals to bring out extra minions. We&#8217;ll see if that ends up making it to PBE any time soon, but for now, Ohmwrecker is your only option.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Righteous_Glory_item.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-22081" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Righteous_Glory_item.png" alt="Righteous_Glory_item" width="64" height="64" /></a>Righteous Glory</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">+500 health</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">+300 mana</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">+100% base health regen</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><strong>Unique Passive- Valor&#8217;s Reward: </strong>Upon leveling up, restores 150 health and 200 mana over 8 seconds.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><strong>Unique Active:</strong> Grants +60% movement speed to nearby allies when moving towards enemies or enemy turrets for 3 seconds. After 3 seconds, a shockwave is emitted, slowing nearby enemy champion movement speed by 80% for 1 second (60s cooldown). The effect may be reactivated early to instantly release the shockwave.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">Builds from Catalyst + Crystalline Bracer + 700g for a total of 2500g.</p>
<p>Righteous Glory is a pretty cool new item geared towards tanky initiators. It builds from Catalyst, so it has limited effectiveness on champions without mana, but it works pretty well on any tanky character with a mana pool. It basically fills the niche that Shurelia&#8217;s Reverie used to fill on some initiators, before the gotta-go-fast active was moved to Talisman of Ascension.</p>
<p>Talisman, however, is a support gold item, so anyone outside of bottom lane can&#8217;t feasibly pick it up. Righteous Glory solves that problem by giving non-support tanks a way to get the team-wide speed boost that&#8217;s actually stronger than the one on Talisman. This item will really help tanky initiator top-laners and junglers get back into viability. Looking at you, Skarner my old friend.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Ohmwrecker_item.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-22084" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Ohmwrecker_item.png" alt="Ohmwrecker_item" width="64" height="64" /></a>Ohmwrecker (redesigned)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">+300 health</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">+50 armour</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">+100% base health regen</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">+10% CDR</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><strong>Unique passive- Point Runner:</strong> Builds up to +30% movement speed over 2 seconds while near turrets.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><strong>Unique Active: </strong>Prevents nearby enemy turrets from attacking for 3 seconds (120 second cooldown). This effect cannot be used against the same turret more than once every 8 seconds.</p>
<p>Ohmwrecker is one of those niche items that&#8217;s niche to the point of nobody building it. Right now on live, it&#8217;s a tanky-AP item that nullifies turrets. The preseason is seeing it be a little more broadly useable, as it now just has tank stats on it and no damage. The CDR is nice too.</p>
<p>The active is still the same thing as live, with a slight buff to the time on the turret deactivation. However, it also has the Point Runner passive from Raptor Cloak, which has some nice merits to it. This item is still probably going to stay pretty niche, but maybe will be bought a little more often for when teams want to get super-divey.</p>
<h3>Back to Reality</h3>
<p>That&#8217;s about it for preseason stuff as of now. There&#8217;s a lot to look through, I know, but I&#8217;m very excited for the upcoming changes to the game (and not just because I&#8217;m a jungle main!) As I said earlier, I do hope that these changes hit live soon, but there&#8217;s a possibility that we won&#8217;t see them for another patch or two. However, there are still some regular changes that will definitely go in the next live patch, so let&#8217;s take a look at some of those.</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Balance Changes</h3>
<h4>Champion Balance</h4>
<p>Before I begin, let me just mention that several champions have received some changes to their base stats for the preseason, which means that some of these changes are going to look a little bit odd.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/kalista_square.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-22049" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/kalista_square.png" alt="kalista_square" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/kalista_square.png 120w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/kalista_square-75x75.png 75w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/kalista_square-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>New Champion: Kalista</strong></p>
<p>A new champion has hit the PBE this cycle; Kalista, the Spear of Vengeance! I wanted to focus more on preseason in this article, so I won&#8217;t say much more about her, but you can check out <strong><a href="http://www.surrenderat20.net/2014/11/114-pbe-update.html">S@20&#8217;s report</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/champion-reveal/kalista-spear-vengeance-revealed">Riot&#8217;s official reveal</a></strong> if you haven&#8217;t already seen them.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Amumu_Square_0.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2260" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Amumu_Square_0.png" alt="Amumu_Square_0" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Amumu_Square_0.png 120w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Amumu_Square_0-50x50.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a>Amumu</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Despair (W) </b>damage changed to 1/1.5/2/2.5/3%  of enemies maximum health from 1.5/1.8/2.1/2.4/2.7%</p>
<p>Amumu&#8217;s Despair  is being rebalanced a bit to be stronger early but weaker late. This is probably due to all of the new health itemisation and the way that regen works now, to make Amumu&#8217;s percent-health damage a little smoother.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AzirSquare.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-20752" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AzirSquare.png" alt="AzirSquare" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AzirSquare.png 120w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AzirSquare-75x75.png 75w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AzirSquare-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a>Azir</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Conquering Sands (Q) </b>Sand Soldier damage increased to 75/105/135/165/195 from 60/90/120/150/180</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Arise (W)</b> AP ratios decreased to .6 from .7</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Shifting Sands (E) </b>shield value increased to 80/120/160/200/240 from 60/100/140/180/220</p>
<p>Azir still isn&#8217;t where we want, so he&#8217;s getting buffed a bit more. His Q and E are being increased in their effectiveness, with a bit of a nerf to his soldiers&#8217; autoattacks.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Fiora_Square_0.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2233" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Fiora_Square_0.png" alt="Fiora_Square_0" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Fiora_Square_0.png 120w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Fiora_Square_0-50x50.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a>Fiora</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Blade Waltz (R) </b>base damage lowered to 125/255/385 from 160/330/500</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Blade Waltz (R) </b>successive strikes against same target damage increased to 40% from 25%</p>
<p>Fiora has actually been a bit of a pain lately. Her effectiveness in teamfights is a bit much from her ultimate, so it&#8217;s being nerfed considerably in terms of base damage. However, the damage against repeated targets is being increased a bit to compensate and buff her dueling potential. After all, she is a duelist.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gnar_square.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-19864" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gnar_square.png" alt="gnar_square" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gnar_square.png 120w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gnar_square-75x75.png 75w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/gnar_square-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a>Gnar</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Base Health Regen </b>lowered slightly</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Rage Gene (Passive) </b>stats adjusted slightly, Mini MS up, Mega HP/5 up, Mega HP per level up, Mega AD per level up.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Boomerang Throw (Q) </b>damage lowered to 5/35/65/95/125 from 10/45/80/115/150</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Boomerang Throw (Q) </b>AD ratio increased to 1.15 AD from 1 AD</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Boomerang Throw (Q)</b> width increased to 60 from 55</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Boulder Toss (Mega Q) </b>damage lowered to 5/45/85/125/165 from 10/50/90/130/170</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Boulder Toss (Mega Q) </b>AD ratio increased to 1.2 AD from 1.15 AD</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Hyper (W)</b> flat damage lowered to 10/20/30/40/50 from 25/30/35/40/45.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Wallop (Mega W)</b> active cooldown changed to 15/13/11/9/7 from 12/11/10/9/8</p>
<div>The changes to Gnar&#8217;s health regen are mostly just to reflect the preseason stuff. His Q is doing a little bit too much damage in lane (in both forms), so its base damage (in both forms) is being lowered. The damage on his auto-attack enhancement W in small form is being nerfed too, and his early cooldown on his big-W has been increased.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Gnar is a champion with a pretty high skill cap, since you need to be able to time your assaults around his transformation. Now that people are getting better at him, his buffs have made him a little too powerful, so he&#8217;s being toned back a bit.</div>

<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Base health regen</b> increased significantly</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><strong>Techmaturgical Repair Bots (passive)</strong> no longer affects Heimerdinger.</p>
<p>This is really just to balance around preseason stuff.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Death Lotus (R) </b>cooldown increased to 90/60/45 from 60/52.5/45</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Death Lotus (R)</b> damage reduced to 350/550/750 from 400/575/750</p>
<p>Katarina has seen some sudden popularity lately, and is starting to climb back to permaban status. She&#8217;s getting a hit to her ultimate to make her a bit less snowbally.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/KhaZixSquare.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-15136" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/KhaZixSquare.png" alt="KhaZixSquare" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/KhaZixSquare.png 120w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/KhaZixSquare-90x90.png 90w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/KhaZixSquare-50x50.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a>Kha&#8217;zix</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Void Spike</b> <strong>(W)</strong> cooldown increased to 10 seconds from 8 seconds</p>
<p>Riot&#8217;s apparently not quite satisfied with the Kha&#8217;zix nerfs from a few patches back, so they&#8217;re hitting him again slightly. Although, this may be a reaction to preseason regen rebalances.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Rammus_Square_0.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2193" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Rammus_Square_0.png" alt="Rammus_Square_0" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Rammus_Square_0.png 120w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Rammus_Square_0-50x50.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a>Rammus</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Powerball (Q) </b>cooldown increased to 16/14.5/13/11.5/10 from 10 at all ranks.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Puncturing Taunt (E) </b>armor reduction reduced to 5/10/15/20/25 from 10/15/20/25/30</p>
<p>As it turns out, Rammus is OP. Who would have thought? So he&#8217;s getting nerfed. His Powerball cooldown is getting hit really hard at early levels, and his tankiness on his E is being smacked as well. He&#8217;s OK with it though.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sona.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-19168" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sona.png" alt="Sona" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sona.png 120w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sona-75x75.png 75w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sona-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a>Sona</strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Aria of Perseverance (W)</b> base heal increased to 30/50/70/90/110 from 25/45/65/85/105</p>
<p>Sona&#8217;s had a bit of a tweak to her power levels. Her poke is lower due to a nerf on her Q, but her healing is up. She&#8217;ll be less dangerous to stay in lane against, but more easily able to stick in lane with her carry.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Soraka_Square_0.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2170" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Soraka_Square_0.png" alt="Soraka_Square_0" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Soraka_Square_0.png 120w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Soraka_Square_0-50x50.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a>Soraka</strong></p>

<p style="padding-left: 90px"><strong>Equinox (E) </strong>cooldown increased to 24/22/20/18/16 from 18/17/16/15/14</p>
<p>Soraka has recieved a buff to the range on her heal to help her get those ambulance saves in. Her E, however, has been nerfed to have a really high cooldown at early levels, so you&#8217;ll have to be smart about when you use it. Her Q has had a few tweaks to its aiming to make it feel a little more intuitive in when it hits the ground.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Warwick_Square_0.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2158" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Warwick_Square_0.png" alt="Warwick_Square_0" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Warwick_Square_0.png 120w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Warwick_Square_0-50x50.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a>Warwick</strong></p>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><b>Infinite Duress (R) </b>cooldown increased to 110/90/70 from 90/80/70</p>
</div>
<div>Warwick has actually been pretty strong lately if used correctly. If he ganks on every ultimate cooldown, he can severely damage a lane in a very pre-nerf Vi sort of a way. His ult&#8217;s cooldown has gone up to try and prevent this sort of thing from happening.</div>

<p><strong>Pickpocket Twitch</strong></p>
<p>Twitch has received a bit of a facelift. He reminds me of another character, but I can&#8217;t put my finger on who&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/twitchpocket.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22135" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/twitchpocket-620x235.jpg" alt="twitchpocket" width="620" height="235" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/twitchpocket-620x235.jpg 620w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/twitchpocket-300x113.jpg 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/twitchpocket.jpg 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Captain Volibear</strong></p>
<p>Volibear with a mustache and shades is quite possibly the best thing I&#8217;ve ever seen. This is what officer Caitlyn should have looked like.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/stachebear.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22136" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/stachebear-620x235.jpg" alt="stachebear" width="620" height="235" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/stachebear-620x235.jpg 620w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/stachebear-300x113.jpg 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/stachebear.jpg 1189w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Constable Trundle</strong></p>

<p><strong>Battlecast Ward Skin</strong></p>
<p>Kog&#8217;maw and Skarner are bringing a new ward skin with them.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/battleward.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22132" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/battleward.jpg" alt="battleward" width="208" height="238" /></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a long time for most regions since Piltover’s Defender of Tomorrow was seen in competitive play. Jayce was barely a niche pick everywhere but the GPL over the last split. Suddenly, he has come tearing back through his Acceleration Gate to become one of the most hotly-contested picks at worlds, particularly in the Quarterfinals, Semifinals, and Finals.</p>
<p>Today, we’re going to talk about who, when, and why the pros are picking up Jayce again, as well as how they build him.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jayce_0.jpg" alt="" width="549" height="324" /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong>Position</strong></h3>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: center"></h3>
<p>Jayce has been exclusively played in midlane at Worlds. I’m sure it’s viable to run Jayce top or even ADC, depending on the player&#8217;s skills and where in the ladder you go.</p>
<p>This article is focused on competitive play and that means Jayce goes mid. He has had an enormous resurgence at worlds, chiefly in the hands of Samsung Galaxy White’s <strong>PawN</strong>, Samsung Galaxy Blue’s <strong>dade</strong> and OMG’s <strong>Cool</strong>.</p>
<p>No offense to Dark Passage’s Naru or Starhorn Royal Club’s Corn, but their one game each on Jayce was very disappointing, so we’ll not be including them in the analysis.</p>
<p>Prior to worlds, Jayce was not commonly seen in competitive play.</p>
<p>He was picked once in NA’s summer split, never in EU, a few times in Korea’s playoffs, once in China. Three teams ran Jayce extensively in the GPL, (Insidious Rebirth, Saigon Jokers, and Saigon Fantastic Five) none of whom made it to worlds.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong>Pick Order and Team Composition</strong></h3>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: center"></h3>
<p>Jayce was picked almost always towards the end of the draft phase at worlds. This means no earlier than third pick, often fourth or fifth. Picking Jayce is something of a giveaway in terms of strategy and counterpicking midlane is extremely important in competitive play.</p>
<p>Of course, that won’t necessarily apply in solo queue, given how popular mid tends to be as a position, but it’s worth noting.</p>
<p>Where does Jayce fit into team compositions, and what does he bring?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Jayce is one of the safest midlaners</strong>, other than Zed. It’s virtually impossible to stop Jayce from farming thanks to his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pKdpFJ8Ztk">Acceleration Gate/Shock Blast combination</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Jayce does primarily physical damage.</strong> With toplane being dominated by AP picks, such as Ryze, Maokai and Rumble at Worlds, alongside heavier magic-damage ADCs like Corki being popular, having a second source of physical damage in mid prevents the enemy team from stacking MR to negate both of your solo laners’ damage.</li>
<li><strong>Jayce excels on both <em>poke and pick compositions</em>.</strong> His long-range harass allows him to wear down enemies prior to a siege. In a pick composition, Jayce can provide upfront burst as well as a team-haste in the form of Acceleration Gate. In terms of utility, though, let’s be honest: Jayce is mostly about ranged damage and lots of it. His gate is also useful both as an engage/disengage tool, and he does have a knockback and a slow, but his primary<em> role is damage.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>At worlds, teams rarely constrained themselves to a single strategy. Jayce could be found on teams with Lee Sin, Rumble, Morgana and Corki, which have no particularly defined composition but rather elements of several.</p>
<p>Rumble and Morgana both have strong AOE abilities, while Morgana and Lee Sin are good at catching out people with Dark Bindings or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzjT4_aXCl8">Insec-style kicks</a>. Together, Corki and Jayce have very strong siege potential.</p>
<blockquote>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: right"><em><strong>The bottom line &#8211; Jayce fits reasonably well into a wide variety of team compositions, but works best when picked towards the end of the draft phase.</strong></em></p>
<hr />
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong>Summoner Spells</strong></h3>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong><br />
</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left">All Jayce players took</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><img src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Flash.png" alt="" width="64" height="64" /> Flash</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>with</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><img src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ignite.png" alt="" width="64" height="64" /> Ignite</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>or</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><img src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Exhaust.png" alt="" width="64" height="64" /> Exhaust</p>
<p style="text-align: left">There was a <em>strong preference</em> towards taking Exhaust. Exhaust was used <span style="text-decoration: underline"><em>against</em></span> the following champions: Orianna, Lulu, Ryze, and Zed.  Ignite was used <span style="text-decoration: underline"><em>against</em></span> Yasuo and Syndra in only three matches earlier on in the tournament. Later matches preferred Exhaust, and I personally would recommend taking Exhaust as well against Syndra as well. We can surmise Exhaust seemed to be strongly preferred.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong>Runes</strong></h3>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: center"></h3>
<p>Cool, PawN, and dade all had differing setups used for runes on Jayce. Here’s a table that gives the options used at worlds:</p>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/JayceRunes4.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-22039 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/JayceRunes4.jpg" alt="JayceRunes4" width="499" height="100" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/JayceRunes4.jpg 499w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/JayceRunes4-300x60.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" /></a></p>
<p>Let’s evaluate some of the rune choices with math. First, I’d like to talk about the choice of <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff">Quintessences</span> </strong>and <strong><span style="color: #ff0000">Marks</span></strong>. Let’s see which one will give the most damage, looking primarily at accelerated Shock Blasts and Hyper Charge.</p>
<p>Most of Jayce’s other spells do not contribute as heavily to his main damage rotations. Note that Thundering Blow scales off of AD but does magic damage, so flat AD will benefit that spell more. It’s also the spell you max next-to-last.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000">Marks</span> + <span style="color: #ff00ff">Quints</span>: </strong></p>
<p>The first rune comparisons I&#8217;d like to analyze is with Marks and Quints (red and purple runes). There are four setups to compare:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Setup 1: </strong>1 AD, 2 Armor Pen Quints, 9 Armor Pen Reds (2.25 AD, 16.64 Armor Pen)</li>
<li><strong>Setup 2: </strong>3 AD Quints, 9 Armor Pen Reds (6.75 bonus AD, 11.52 Armor Pen)</li>
<li><strong>Setup 3: </strong>1 AD, 2 Armor Pen Quints, 9 AD Reds (10.8 bonus AD, 5.12 Armor Pen)</li>
<li><strong>Setup 4: </strong>3 AD Quints, 9 AD Reds (15.3 bonus AD)</li>
</ul>
<p>I tabulated the results in Excel, comparing the four options against each other, primarily looking at auto-attacks, Accelerated Shock Blasts, and Hyper Charge. <strong><em>Note that Jayce’s melee spells are primarily used for their utility and aren’t the important parts of his damage pattern.</em></strong></p>
<p>The numbers in this table represent which rune setup listed above is most efficient at different armor and damage levels. Setup 1 is in white, 3 in lighter green and 4 in dark green. As you can see, with apologies to dade, who used this setup against Cloud9, setup #3 (1 AD quint, 2 Armor Pen Quints, 9 AD reds) is <strong>never mathematically efficient</strong>, thus not shown on the graph. Setup #2, (3 AD quints, 9 Armor Pen reds) used by Cool, is only efficient for brief windows, overshadowed by all AD (setup #4) early game and a heavy armor pen setup (setup #1) lategame.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/JayceADRunes.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-22042 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/JayceADRunes.png" alt="JayceADRunes" width="528" height="244" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/JayceADRunes.png 528w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/JayceADRunes-300x138.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" /></a></p>
<p>One interesting thing to note is that setup #4 (3 AD Quints, 9 AD reds) is the early game winner, while setup #1 (1 AD Quint, 2 ArPen quints, 9 ArPen reds) wins lategame.  It&#8217;s worth noting that setup #3 is inferior to 3 AD quints, 5 AD marks, and 4 Armor Pen marks, which gives the same Armor Pen and more AD. None of the pros at worlds used this setup, so thanks to Leliel in the comments for pointing that out!</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that this comparison is only for damage against champions. Against minions, a setup with more AD will make last-hitting easier. Also, AD is useful against towers, whereas armor penetration has no effect.</p>
<p>While To The Skies! can hurt, its scaling is less than Accelerated Shock Blast and it’s either used to set up a Thundering Blow, or as a finishing move. Your primary damage sources are accelerated Shock Blasts and Hyper Charge.</p>
<p>Thundering Blow scales off of AD but does magic damage, so it always benefits from AD and not from Armor Pen. However, it’s also always maxed next to last.</p>
<p>Note that dade uses 8 AD and 1 Critical Chance mark. If you like to trust a little in luck, there’s nothing wrong about mixing in a Critical Chance mark into either your Armor Penetration or Attack Damage setup. It won’t materially affect our analysis here though.</p>
<blockquote>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: right"><em><strong>I think the choice is playstyle and last-hitting dependent. If you prefer easier last-hitting, use AD marks. If you want to do a bit more damage to champions, particularly lategame, go with armor penetration marks.</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: right">
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless, 2 Armor Penetration and 1 Attack Damage Quintessence seemed to be the most commonly preferred strategy, unless you’re PawN.</p>
<p>PawN always runs Attack Speed Quintessences on Jayce. Since Jayce doesn’t need attack speed as a stat, this has to be purely for last-hitting and pushing power. Hyper-Charge gives Jayce max attack speed for his next three attacks and since Jayce is primarily a spell-based champion, there’s little benefit to his damage rotation from attack speed compared to AD or armor penetration.</p>
<p>I don’t completely understand why PawN does this, but there may be some subtle animation timing issue where having the faster attack speed animation helps him land more auto-attacks and last-hits while repositioning.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ffcc00">Seals</span> + <span style="color: #00ccff">Glyphs<span style="color: #000000">:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>The second comparison I’d like to make is concerning <span style="color: #ffcc00"><strong>Seals</strong></span> and <span style="color: #00ccff"><strong>Glyphs</strong></span> (yellow and blue runes). Against magic damage opponents like Syndra, it was very common to see 9 HP/level seals and 9 MR blues, and that’s more-or-less standard anyway. Against physical damage opponents like Yasuo, Zed, or Talon, there were two setups used at worlds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double Armor &#8211; 9 armor seals, 9 armor glyphs</li>
<li>HP/Level &#8211; 9 HP/level seals and 9 armor glpyhs</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that 9 HP/level glyphs are radically inferior to 9 HP/level seals, so any option involving those glyphs will be inferior. No detailed comparison is needed here. Since we’re talking about per level seals, I’ll examine levels 1, 3, 6, and 9.</p>
<p><strong>At levels 1 and 3</strong>, the double armor option gives more effective physical health however they are beaten by level 6 by the HP/level seals setup.</p>
<p><strong> By level 9</strong>, it’s around 60 more damage that you’re able to absorb by using HP/level seals over armor seals. Note: I am assuming that you’re not building Jayce tanky and so am only looking at his <em>base stats growth.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: right"><em><strong>Since HP/level seals also add additional protection against magic and true damage, I’m going to recommend running them over the double-armor options.</strong></em></p>
<hr />
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure why PawN favored those over HP/level seals, especially against Zed and Yasuo, who have some magic damage in their kits and neither should be able to kill Jayce pre-six without assistance. Note that dade favored mixing in CDR blues, instead of full MR blues, for a more offensive setup.</p>
<p><strong>As such, here would be my recommended rune setups after comparing those used by the pros at worlds. </strong></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong>Masteries</strong></h3>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: center"></h3>
<p>There was nothing particularly surprising for masteries used during Worlds. The most common Jayce setup was 21/0/9, though 21/9/0 was used twice. The vast majority of the games, the Jayce player took the following masteries:</p>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/JayceMasteries.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-21836 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/JayceMasteries.png" alt="JayceMasteries" width="538" height="326" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/JayceMasteries.png 538w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/JayceMasteries-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong>Build</strong></h3>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: center"></h3>
<p style="text-align: left">The core items for Jayce were always a Tear of the Goddess into Manamune, Brutalizer, Last Whisper and CDR Boots. If the Worlds pros are any example, that’s what you should looking to build every single game, along with lots of wards.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Jayce started with a ward trinket and transitioned to a sweeper or scrying orb fairly quickly afterward.</p>
<blockquote>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: right"><em><strong>Every single Jayce player started with a Long Sword and three health potions.</strong></em></p>
<hr />
</blockquote>
<p>Additional offensive items include either a Black Cleaver or Youmuu’s Ghostblade and a Bloodthirster or Essence Reaver. Jayce players didn’t build a lot of defensive items, but Banshee’s Veil, Quicksilver Sash, and Hexdrinker were popular items. I imagine Guardian Angel would have been an inviting choice against more AD assassins as well had the games gone long enough.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jayce-Builds2.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-21837 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jayce-Builds2.png" alt="Jayce Builds" width="521" height="141" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jayce-Builds2.png 521w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jayce-Builds2-300x81.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /></a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong>Skill order</strong></h3>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: center"></h3>
<p>Every single Jayce player was maxing Q &gt; W &gt; E &gt; R, taking E at level 2 to unlock Acceleration Gate. The only differences were that some Jayce players took W at level 3, while others took their first point in W at level 4. The difference is playstyle and match-up dependent.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong>Playstyle</strong></h3>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: center"></h3>
<p>Jayce was picked pretty much regardless of lane matchup. He was matched against AD assassins like Zed and Yasuo, AP burst mages like Syndra and utility mages like Orianna or Zilean. Looking at their KDA and CS scores, it’s hard to obtain any patterns from raw matchup alone.</p>
<p><strong><em>He’s generally a safe pick in lane and excels at poking down opponents.</em> </strong></p>
<p>His level 3 all-in is deceptively strong, but post-6 Jayce doesn’t have as much all-in threat as someone like Syndra or Zed without jungler intervention, unless he’s already gained an advantage over his opponent.</p>
<p>Jayce didn’t pick up too many solo kills in lane, but his burst combination gives him a lot of damage to combine with a jungler or on a roaming kill. It was also pretty hard to kill a smart Jayce in lane. Though he lacks an easy escape, his range and knockback allow him to avoid a lot of kill attempts and ganks.</p>
<p><strong>The important thing to remember is that Jayce’s power spike, like most transforming champions, occurs early game.</strong></p>
<p>He’s strong at level 2 with his Acceleration Gate combination, and even stronger at 3 with access to Hyper-Charge. Then, he’ll remain fairly passive while stacking Tear of the Goddess, avoiding trades and seeking to charge it up at least until a Manamune is finished.</p>
<p>Once that item is complete, preferably with a Brutalizer, Jayce players should attempt to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>B<em>ully opponent out of lane,</em> being careful to avoid all-ins that won’t guarantee a kill</li>
<li><em>Force dragon fights</em></li>
<li><em>Roam for kills</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Jayce is not great at diving into fights unless opponents are poked down first, so resist the urge to go hammer form too early. Accelerated Shock Blast is probably the best poke spell in the game, especially when paired with a Corki, so take advantage of that to wear enemies down before contesting dragon or tower diving.</p>
<p>Jayce won’t spike again until he finishes Muramana or a Last Whisper. Once he has his core items, Jayce is about as strong as he’ll ever be, particularly once Hyper Charge and Shock Blast are maxed. Lategame, depending on the rest of your teamfight, it’s preferable to drag out fights into prolonged siege situations where Jayce can wear the enemy down.</p>
<p>Acceleration Gate has a long cooldown, so if you miss the Accelerated Shock Blast and the enemy team isn’t already hurt or outnumbered or way behind, it’s not a good time to fight. When you go into a fight, make sure to turn the Muramana on in order to benefit from the extra damage on your Hyper Charge!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align: center"></h3>
<p>Jayce turned out to be one of the surprise picks at Worlds in 2014. He was played extensively in the later rounds of bracket stage and was a force to be reckoned with, often completely taking over games with early roam or objective fights.</p>
<p>Accelerated Shock Blast hurts a lot, and should be used to soften up targets, while diving in is generally reserved to finish off low enemies, or set up a clutch knock-back. Jayce is a safe AD-based midlaner who excels at poke and early-mid game.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to add Jayce to your repertoire of mid-laners, here’s the recommended setup for him, based on what the pros used at worlds:</p>
<p><strong>Runes: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>9 AD or 9 armor penetration <strong><span style="color: #ff0000">marks</span></strong>. Could also mix in 1 crit <strong><span style="color: #ff0000">mark</span></strong></li>
<li>3 AD <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff">Quintessences</span></strong> or 2 ArPen and 1 AD <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff">Quintessences</span></strong>  (or 3 Attack Speed <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff">Quintessences</span></strong>)</li>
<li>9 HP/level <span style="color: #ffcc00"><strong>seals</strong></span></li>
<li>9 Armor or MR <span style="color: #00ccff"><strong>glyphs</strong></span> (depending on matchup). Could also mix in 6 CDR <strong><span style="color: #00ccff">glyphs</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Masteries</strong></p>

<p><strong>Summoner Spells<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Default to Flash/Exhaust. Flash/Ignite is another possibility.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the set-up for Jayce, based on what the pros were using at Worlds. Think you can do better? Have a neat Jayce trick that you think makes you better than PawN, Cool, or dade? Post a comment below and share it. And, as always, thanks for reading!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everybody! <strong>blue_lights</strong> here. I’ll be dropping by here at Cloth5 to bring you ladies and gentlemen exclusive news on the up-and-coming Japanese LoL scene!</p>
<p>With the Japanese servers planned for release in the near future, I figured it would be a great time to dive my way a little deeper into Japan’s world of Esports. Recently, I had the opportunity to interview with Detonation FM, Japan’s top LoL team, fresh off their championship win in the <a href="http://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/2014_League_of_Legends_Japan_League/Grand_Finals">L.J League Grand Finals</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_21890" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DETVICTORY1.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-21890" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DETVICTORY1-620x299.png" alt="DetonatioN FM team looking happy after their championship win.

<h5><span style="color: #ff6600"><strong>First of all, congratulations on your LJL season victory! Can you start us off with an introduction for yourself and the team?</strong></span></h5>
<p>Sure! My name is LGraN and I&#8217;m working as both the CEO of the multi-gaming team DetonatioN and the manager of DetonatioN FM. Personally, I come from a background of being a player as well.</p>
<p>I was the Japanese representative at WCF2012 for Counter-Strike Online. In May, 2013, I retired as a player and moved on to the role of the CEO for DetonatioN. It was at this time as well that I started working to expand the organization as the manager of DetFM.</p>
<p>As far as DetonatioN FM goes, the official team name is DetonatioN FocusMe. The team originally began as FocusMe, and sometime around April of 2013 we began our affiliation with DetonatioN.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #ff6600"><strong>What originally struck you as an opportunity for creating the team FocusMe?</strong></span></h5>
<p>As Esports wasn’t very well known throughout Japan, I didn’t think that awareness would spread with just a single game title. Despite there being no server in Japan, I decided it was a good opportunity to add on a team for LoL, which was already popular around the world.</p>
<p>At the time, DetonatioN already had sponsors from Zowie and GIGABYTE, and FocusMe was a group of players who were aiming to be professional. That’s when we decided to form the team together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #ff6600"><strong>What sort of backgrounds are the players coming from? Prior to playing LoL, what other games did everyone play?</strong></span></h5>
<div id="attachment_21896" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/11.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-21896" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/11-300x199.jpg" alt="Quick shot of the DetFM booth at the championship hosted at the Tokyo Game Show. " width="300" height="199" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/11-300x199.jpg 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/11-620x413.jpg 620w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/11-330x220.jpg 330w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/11.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Quick shot of the DetFM booth at the championship hosted at the Tokyo Game Show.</p></div>
<p>The players had come from a variety of backgrounds. Ceros was originally a Special Forces 2 (FPS) player, Riosilva and yutapon played Fantasy Earth Zero. In the end, the reason everyone ended up on LoL was partly due to the game being interesting and partly due to people gathering where the players are.</p>
<p>There were a lot of players in Japan, and the game was gaining popularity globally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #ff6600"><strong>League does have the power to bring people together doesn’t it…</strong></span></h5>
<p>It does! LoL’s charm definitely attracts people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #ff6600"><strong>On a side note, what do you think that charm is? What kind of things do you think are necessary to attract players to a PvP game who have no experience in the genre?</strong></span></h5>
<p>LoL’s charm lies in the fact that there are a ton of champions rich with personality and because each update brings changes to the champion’s abilities, more trial-and-error are required each day. Also, thanks to the ranking system you are able to clearly see your skill level, which ties in to keeping your motivation (toward the game) high.</p>
<p>In order to attract new players who have never played this type of game before, I think it’s necessary to simplify the games tutorial. However, Riot is focused on core gamers, so that plan may be the secret to the game’s popularity. Once you get hooked, you’re stuck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #ff6600"><strong>Sorry for the tough questions! Once the official server in Japan opens up, what sort of things do you want to be implemented? Are there and specific champs you would like to see, or perhaps voice actors you would like to hear?</strong></span></h5>
<p><em><strong>Personally, I would love to see a school uniform as a skin… haha!</strong></em>  As for champions, Yasuo is already available as a samurai character, so that’s good for the time being!</p>
<p>There are a ton of voice actors I would like to see in the game, but I think it would be a great idea to open up a survey to the fans in Japan and have them decide!</p>
<div id="attachment_21908" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/022l.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-21908" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/022l.jpg" alt="Let's be honest...

<h5><span style="color: #ff6600"><strong>A school uniform would be great… Moving back to the topic of the LJL, what are some good points about the team that helped contribute to your victory this season? Thinking about the future and competing with teams around the world, what do you think is necessary to prepare?</strong></span></h5>
<p>During the Winter Season of the LJL this year, our team finished in <em>last place</em>. Despite having <strong>Yutapon</strong> and <strong>Ceros</strong>, the top players representing Japan, on the team, we lacked a player who could command them and shot-call well. To compensate for that, we added <strong>Riosilva</strong> to the team.</p>
<p>We also added on <strong>BonziN</strong> and <strong>Astarore</strong>, both highly skilled players to complete the team. With this solid roster, we took victories in the Spring and Summer Seasons. The biggest factor in this was definitely the addition of a shot-caller.</p>
<p>In order for DetFM to compete with global teams, an analyst for our team is essential. It’s not possible to stand up to other teams on a global level without somebody who can instruct the team on the current meta and picks / bans from an outside standpoint. Payments for the players and a gaming house will come along when we start producing results, so we have to start from there.</p>
<p>By the way, DetFM just succeeded in acquiring <strong>Kazu</strong> from one of our rival teams, Ozone Rampage, in order to start competing globally. Kazu is aiming to become the best<em> analyst</em> in the world, and his strategies and tactics are very highly regarded in Japan. I think the day in which DetFM is well-known around the world is getting closer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #ff6600"><strong>Next season should be quite interesting! To finish things off, do you have any shout-outs to your fans around the world or people with an interest in the Japanese LoL scene?</strong></span></h5>
<p>I think LoL’s popularity will boom next year thanks to the opening of the Japanese server. Please look forward to the day when a Japanese team rises up to the WCS stage. When that day comes, I’m positive that that team will be DetFM! Please keep rooting for us!</p>
<hr />
<p>That will wrap up the interview with DetFM! Thanks again to LGraN for taking time out of his schedule to participate in this interview! Let me know what you thought about the interview in the comments below, or what other kind of content you guys would be interested in seeing about the Japanese scene!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">This is Team Fusion, a new up-and-comer in the challenger scene. The team&#8217;s roster was officially announced <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamFusiongg/status/525398680002916352">via twitter</a> on October 23rd and quickly set the community abuzz with the daring lineup.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to sit down with the team and its owner Veyloris to discuss the team&#8217;s beginnings and their chances in the upcoming expansion tournament. Here are their thoughts:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"> Starting Roster</h3>
<hr />
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Jungle &#8211; Nintendude</h4>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Nintendude-01.bmp"><img class="wp-image-21932 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Nintendude-01-300x168.bmp" alt="Nintendude 01" width="525" height="294" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Nintendude-01-300x168.bmp 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Nintendude-01-620x348.bmp 620w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></a></h3>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Josh &#8220;<strong>Nintendude</strong>&#8221; Atkins</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 20</p>
<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Toledo, Ohio</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned in First Blood that you got flown out first class. How would you compare that experience to how you&#8217;ve been treated by other organizations in the past?</strong></p>
<p>Flying first class was an experience I won&#8217;t soon forget&#8230; Let&#8217;s just say I’m not looking forward to flying coach ever again.</p>
<p>Fusion has treated me so well ever since I first had talks with them about their desire for me to play for them&#8230; In fact the talks were going so well I was kind of sketched out.</p>
<p>There are quite a few organizations in the challenger scene that make promises they can’t keep or just flat out lie to try and suck people in. So far Fusion has made me feel very comfortable and I feel like a part of a family here.</p>
<p><strong>Obviously we don&#8217;t want to give away too many secrets, but are we going to be seeing any jungle Leona-type pocket picks?</strong></p>
<p>Something I hear a lot when my name is brought up as a jungler is that people really miss the surprise picks, even if they aren’t so successful (the jungle Leona definitely comes to mind here). I can’t promise any crazy picks, but I am trying to re-channel myself onto some of the positives that made me a great jungler in the past, and theory-crafting new stuff is definitely part of that.</p>
<p><strong>Are you starting to build strong synergy with any player in particular?</strong></p>
<p>As much as I love Huhi and am looking forward to building more synergy with him, I feel like my synergy with Gleeb is getting really good. Support and Jungle coordinate on most of the vision control and so far it has been going well.</p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t hesitate when I ask him to do something and I give him that same respect when he needs me to do something. It&#8217;s not always easy to see jungle-support synergy, but it feels very noticeable when playing with Gleeb.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Mid &#8211; HuHi</h4>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Huhi-01.bmp"><img class="wp-image-21924 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Huhi-01-300x168.bmp" alt="Huhi 01" width="525" height="294" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Huhi-01-300x168.bmp 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Huhi-01-620x348.bmp 620w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Name</strong>: Jae-Hyun &#8220;<strong>HuHi</strong>&#8221; Choi</p>
<p><strong>Age</strong>: 19</p>
<p><strong>Hometown</strong>: Paris, France. South Korea</p>
<p><strong>Your teammates are all well-known names in the NA scene. Do you think that their popularity will help take the pressure off of you?</strong></p>
<p>Not really. Only because if I don&#8217;t play well, i&#8217;ll still be disappointing myself, which is more important to me than what the fans think.</p>
<p><strong>What are the biggest differences you notice between Korea and NA?</strong></p>
<p>The solo queue experiences definitely differ hugely. In Korea, players are a lot more calculated, whereas in America, games are more exciting.</p>
<p>People like to take more risks and don’t play so precisely and safe. People are willing to take big risks, which can be a good or a bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>Does it help to have a Korean coach? Do you think he understands your playstyle better?</strong></p>
<p>Korean coaches are far more focused on improving Korean players skills, whereas my experience with North American coaches so far, they’ve been focusing more on making sure I’m well acclimated to being in the house and working with my team. In this case, I think that’s better, since I was definitely able to start playing at full capacity faster, since I was comfortable so quickly.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"> AD Carry &#8211; Nien</h4>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Nien-01.bmp"><img class="wp-image-21927 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Nien-01-300x168.bmp" alt="Nien 01" width="525" height="294" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Nien-01-300x168.bmp 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Nien-01-620x348.bmp 620w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Name</strong>: Zach &#8220;<strong>Nien</strong>&#8221; Malhas</p>
<p><strong>Age</strong>: 20</p>
<p><strong>Hometown</strong>: SoCal</p>
<p><strong>The last time you played AD was with Team MRN about a year and a half ago. Are you still as confident in the position as you were then?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not nearly as confident as I used to be as an AD, though I am 100% confident that I <em>can</em> become even better than I once was, I am going to be the best AD in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Has working with Doublelift allowed you to gain additional insight into the position?</strong></p>
<p>Playing with Double has given me some additional insight into bot lane most definitely, though not nearly as much as I would&#8217;ve expected. I was a lot closer in skill level to him than I had thought before joining CLG.</p>
<p><strong>Have you learned anything in top lane that you can bring back down to the duo lane?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve improved a lot in various aspects of play from top lane, but in 1v1 dueling, split pushing, as well as map and jungle awareness most specifically.</p>
<p><strong>How is the synergy with Gleeb coming along?</strong></p>
<p>The synergy with Gleeb is coming along alright, we have some different ideas about certain things but we&#8217;re improving and I think we can be very solid.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Support &#8211; Gleebglarbu</h4>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gleeb-01.bmp"><img class="wp-image-21922 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gleeb-01-300x168.bmp" alt="Gleeb 01" width="525" height="294" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gleeb-01-300x168.bmp 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gleeb-01-620x348.bmp 620w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Name</strong>: Nicolas &#8220;<strong>Gleebglarbu</strong>&#8221; Haddad</p>
<p><strong>Age</strong>: 18</p>
<p><strong>Hometown</strong>: Agoura Hills, California</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel like you&#8217;re fitting in well with the new setup, team and management?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m really enjoying the new setup, team and management.  The house is currently a bit cramped because we have the whole support staff living with us, but everyone is easy to get along with and very motivated.</p>
<p>I really like the team, in and out of game.  Their personalities mesh well with mine and I feel that it&#8217;s really easy to communicate with them.  We joke around a lot outside of the game but when we play we treat it like our job.</p>
<p><strong>How to do you think Noblesse and Veyloris stack up to your previous experiences?</strong></p>
<p>Management has been incredibly professional, similar to TSM/C9T, which I really like.</p>
<p>Fusion knows how to set up a team and provide us with all the tools we need to succeed which helps relieve stress off of me and the rest of the team.</p>
<p><strong>Many would say there is a lot to prove after the previous criticisms while on TSM, do you feel like your time away from the scene has helped?</strong></p>
<p>I feel like my short time away from the scene has helped me greatly.  I began meeting with a psychiatrist and therapist on a regular basis and began taking prescription medication to deal with anxiety and sleeping issues.  I still play League of Legends 12+ hours most days but I am in a much better place mentally and I&#8217;m better prepared to deal with the stress of pro gaming.</p>
<p><strong>Will you be playing as Gleeb or Gleebglarbu?</strong></p>
<p>I will be playing as Gleebglarbu.  This is the ID I&#8217;ve used in every tournament until I joined TSM and was asked to abbreviate it.  Realistically, the ID you play with is not important but I am quite fond of my name &#8220;Gleebglarbu&#8221;.  It&#8217;s also enjoyable to see how many different ways it can be pronounced wrong.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Top</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Yoon &#8220;MakNooN&#8221; Ha-woon will play Top for Team Fusion, but has not yet joined the team at their gaming house.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Arrival Date ~ 1st November</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Substitute Players</h3>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;"> Well-known Challenger players BeeSin and Chunky will also be joining the team as subs, this is what they had to say about their experience:</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>BeeSin</strong></h4>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Bee-Sin-01.bmp"><img class="wp-image-21915 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Bee-Sin-01-300x168.bmp" alt="Bee Sin 01" width="525" height="294" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Bee-Sin-01-300x168.bmp 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Bee-Sin-01-620x348.bmp 620w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Name</strong>: Keaton &#8220;<strong>BeeSin</strong>&#8221; Cryer</p>
<p><strong>Age</strong>: 20</p>
<p><strong>Hometown</strong>: Nashville, Tennessee</p>
<p><strong>Position</strong>: Top</p>
<p><strong>How does one train to be a sub? Are you an understudy to a particular role or do you play as a generalist?</strong></p>
<p>Training as a sub is basically the same as training like a team member. We both seek to improve our champion pools and practice the Meta champs. Waking up the same time as the team, eating with them, practicing the same amount of hours with them and learning with the team.</p>
<p>I would be studying top lane mostly, if not strictly. I would be learning under Maknoon and practicing with him and against him. I love watching over replays and VODs, so watching his replays would be a treat.</p>
<p><strong>What do you hope to learn from being a sub for Team Fusion?</strong></p>
<p>I want to improve my champion pool and improve as a player in general, which I think is the most important for any player. Maknoon is one of the few top laners I looked up to in terms of play, so learning under him is a treat.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like being picked up out of Challenger? Dream come true of the next step in your career?</strong></p>
<p>Surreal. I helped get some of the members on the team and actually make it a &#8216;thing&#8217;, not thinking about myself being a player for the team, let alone a sub.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when they asked me if I&#8217;d like to be an in-house sub, which is a dream any/most gamers have. As far as whether it’s a dream come true or the next step, it’s a bit of both. It&#8217;s a dream come true to be able to move out to Cali and play.</p>
<p>Hopefully it&#8217;s the next step in my career in terms of player development and growth. I want this to be my career while I&#8217;m still young and I plan on making it a reality.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Chunky</h4>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Chunky-Fresh-01.bmp"><img class="wp-image-21918 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Chunky-Fresh-01-300x168.bmp" alt="Chunky Fresh 01" width="525" height="294" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Chunky-Fresh-01-300x168.bmp 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Chunky-Fresh-01-620x348.bmp 620w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Name</strong>: Joshua &#8220;<strong>Chunky</strong>&#8221; Kesrawani</p>
<p><strong>Age</strong>: 18</p>
<p><strong>Hometown</strong>: Nevada</p>
<p><strong>Position</strong>: Mid</p>
<p><strong>How does one train to be a sub? Are you an understudy to a particular role, or do you play as a generalist?</strong></p>
<p>I train by analyzing games and picking up on stuff I’m missing in a team environment, mostly focused on mid lane.</p>
<p><strong>What do you hope to learn from being a sub for Team Fusion?</strong></p>
<p>How to communicate better with your teammates and how to ready myself to be part of LCS one day.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like being picked up out of Challenger? Dream come true of the next step in your career?</strong></p>
<p>I never really got any good offers in challenger so when I got contacted by magic I was really interested and shocked. This will definitely be the next step in my career &#8211; learning a lot from the coaches and the players!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Team Questions</h3>
<hr />
<p>After discussions with the individual players, we gathered to discuss the team as a whole:</p>
<p><strong>How have you found the transition from 5 individual players to 1 cohesive team?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nintendude</strong>: Speaking for myself, Gleeb, and Nien &#8211; we’ve all bounced around teams before. We all know what it takes to be the best. It’s been an easy transition so far, but there’s a lot of work be done.</p>
<p><strong>BeeSin</strong>/<strong>Chunky</strong>: For us, the transition has been pretty easy. It’s a little awkward meeting everyone at the start, but after that, it’s just natural.</p>
<p><strong>Have there been any issues with a language barrier?</strong></p>
<p>Only a little bit, mostly with shotcalling. HuHi’s English is good enough for conversation but NA specific slang like “cheese”, “end” or even just “b” are things that go over his head.</p>
<p>In-game, it’s faster and the language is a lot more compressed. There’s some language barrier just because of the speed of communication needed. In the moment, it’s somewhat hard sometimes, but out of game for team-wide discussions, it’s been very easy and natural.</p>
<p><strong>Building synergy is something that takes a lot of time, what have you done to try to overcome this for the expansion tournament?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve played 40 games in 4-5 days in ranked 5s. It’s a long grind to just work on it, but we’re basically just spending a lot of time together. There’s a lot of team bonding we’re all doing together. People going to the gym together, eating together and that sort of thing.</p>
<p>It’s really just about spending time together in everything we do.</p>
<p><strong>In your experience is building synergy from scratch easier or harder than rebuilding synergy when one or two members join the team?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gleeb</strong>: It’s a lot easier with new people. Having a basic slate to start everyone building synergy with is easy.</p>
<p><strong>Team</strong>: When MakNooN comes, we think it’ll be a little weird. Bee Sin has been filling the role top and he’s been playing a lot with us. We’ve built a fair amount of synergy over the past few days through the raw amount of games. On the other hand, MakNooN is an excellent player with excellent ethic.</p>
<p>We think the amount of time he’ll be able to work with us is huge. For example, HuHi came into the house and immediately started solo queuing. That sort of ethic has helped him build the synergy so far and with MakNooN, it should be the same.</p>
<p><strong>There are some big names on the team with a lot of competitive experience, how are you planning on keeping any potential egos in check?</strong></p>
<p>Coaching staff. Having coaches helps to stop there from being a Lord of the Flies situation. There’s always a mediator and someone with authority to overrule any ego discussions.</p>
<p>Everyone should always respect the coaches and always having a ‘neutral’ authority in the team in the house helps to defuse those situations. Having the coaches and staff in the house help, since they can stop small problems from blowing up with their experience.</p>
<p><strong> What sort of reactions have you had from stream viewers and fans?</strong></p>
<p>Everyone seems very hyped and we seem to already have a fan base.</p>
<p>People are really wanting to wait and see MakNooN play again before getting too behind the team but in general, there’s been a ton of hype. Nien being ADC and MakNooN coming to NA are huge. People have always wanted to see that and now that it’s happening on the same team, it’s huge. I’m sure it’ll be bigger after we start winning some games.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"> Support Staff</h3>
<hr />
<p>In addition to a star-studded lineup, Team Fusion is also bringing in a brand new support staff. Here are their thoughts on the team and the upcoming expansion tournament:</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Noblesse</strong></h4>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Noblesse-01.bmp"><img class="wp-image-21935 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Noblesse-01-300x168.bmp" alt="Noblesse 01" width="525" height="294" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Noblesse-01-300x168.bmp 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Noblesse-01-620x348.bmp 620w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Name</strong>: Raymond &#8220;<strong>Noblesse</strong>&#8221; Oh</p>
<p><strong>Age</strong>: 24</p>
<p><strong>Hometown</strong>: Chicago, California, Korea</p>
<p><strong>Position</strong>: Head Coach</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose Team Fusion?</strong></p>
<p>Choosing Team Fusion was really a big life change for me – being a coach, or even a pro player wasn’t really my goal in life anymore.</p>
<p>Everything started with me just helping them find players but when they realized they needed a head coach, I was certainly willing to jump into the role. The timing was certainly convenient – I previously had taught English in Korea for large companies, and I was between contracts for doing so.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t have necessarily done something like this on short notice for any team, but I was fortunate to help put the team together and I knew the staff personally. After seeing what the coaches and Alden had been able to achieve together so far, I knew I could be a part of creating something great.</p>
<p><strong>Most fans from NA aren&#8217;t going to know who you are right away. Do you intend to stay behind the scenes or are you a more outgoing coach?</strong></p>
<p>For the moment, I definitely want to stay behind the scenes and just help HuHi and MakNooN acclimate to the environment. In the future, you’ll definitely see me streaming and playing publically, but for now I feel there is too much need of me with the team to have a big public presence.</p>
<p><strong>What sets you apart from other coaches in NA?</strong></p>
<p>Well, most of all, I have a lot of experience. While I haven’t been well known to the public, i’ve been very involved with a lot of players in their gaming houses since season 1. When the Korean server had just started, all of the high plat (the best rank at the time) players really knew each other. It was a really big community.</p>
<p>The big ‘grandfathers’ of the scene are all people I’ve known forever. For example, I’ve known Faker since he was named “Go Jun Pah”, which was well before he was so popular. Basically, in short, I have a huge amount of experience with the Korean scene, which is hard to match.</p>
<p>I lived in the MVP house since before everyone was a ‘great’ player as they’re considered now. I’ve seen how these teams develop over time and I’m sure that with our staff, I can help to recreate the process that made those Korean teams great.</p>
<p><strong>You spent some time at the MVP LoL Gaming house in South Korea. Do you think that your time spent there will improve your coaching ability?</strong></p>
<p>Well, as I said above, of course. There’s a lot of “trade secret” type things that have allowed the Korean teams to develop synergy that western teams have been hard pressed to match.</p>
<p>I’m quite well versed in how to create a successful team environment, and like I said, I can help to recreate the process that really built the Korean hype train from the ground. I don’t want to over-hype Fusion – the process does take time – but if we can stick with it and maintain what we’ve been able to foster in the house so far, Fusion will eventually be a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p><strong>Magic</strong> and <strong>Wei</strong> are coaches and analysts supporting Noblesse and working closely with the players. Here are their thoughts on the team:</p>
<h2></h2>
<p><strong>What is your overall impression of the team&#8217;s synergy so far?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wei:</strong> The group of people we have are all extremely motivated, and the synergy is far more than we could have hoped for in a few days. We see constant improvement on a game to game basis. Different players on the team all bring different things, and they help each other through that.</p>
<p>For example, even as a sub, Bee Sin brings excellent leadership and communication, despite not being the highest ranked player on the team. He’s very well spoken in game, and we think he’ll develop into a great player and leader for a team in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Magic:</strong> I think that the team environment is very positive, especially when compared to other teams. Obviously we haven’t had the stress that is a major competition yet, but people have been very open to coaching and advice from other players. Everyone’s opinion is considered nicely, without regard to ranking or any other factors, especially egos.</p>
<p><strong>How much input on player selection did you have?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wei:</strong> My background with MakNooN is quite extensive. I’ve been a close friend of him for a long time and after he left the scene, he wanted to take a break.</p>
<p>Upon his return to the pro scene and that he wanted me to help him make it into the best possible team to make his return with. Despite having a lot of other options from the LCS, MakNooN thought this team has a huge amount of potential. It’s filled with players that he respects, such as <strong>Nien</strong>.</p>
<p>He had a huge amount of potential as an ADC before going top lane for CLG and I’m honored to be able to help him come back to his home role, as well as aiding MakNooN in his return to the scene. As far as <strong>HuHi</strong> goes, MakNooN immediately suggested HuHi. He thought HuHi was a player who was not only mechanically skilled, but he had the personality that we wanted.</p>
<p>He’s a mature, polite player who has respect for everyone. In addition, he’s a well-traveled player. His parents worked in Embassys globally, and he’s fluent in both English, French and Korean. In addition, he wanted to come to NA, regardless of whether he was on a team or not and that’s a big selling point. We aren’t a foreign team, we’re an NA team. MakNooN and HuHi both wanted to come here independent of League. MakNooN, to marry his girlfriend and HuHi to go to school.</p>
<p>Both myself and Magic were really excited at the idea of developing NA talent with the help of experienced Korean players. Alden really wanted to foster the players and having the premier NA talent working closely with our coaching staff and Koreans achieves what we wanted perfectly. People say that there is no NA talent and Magic and I think that’s not true.</p>
<p>It’s just a matter of coaches scouting out the right players (which we’re always in the process of doing), and turning NA players into the powerhouses they can be. With that said, if you’re an NA player looking to break into the scene, make yourself known! If you can impress us, we have a few more spots in the house.</p>
<p><strong>Magic:</strong> I hand-picked the players that we wanted. <strong>Gleeb</strong> and <strong>MakNooN</strong> were two players I pushed for very early. I knew that I could help to create an environment for Gleeb to succeed and MakNooN is a player I’ve followed for a long time. With those two players as a core, Wei and I talked about what players we wanted for the other roles.</p>
<p>Wei and MakNoon carried a lot of respect for Nien from his time as an ADC on Monomatic and both thought that if he was willing to play ADC that he would be a contender for top ADC in NA once again, and after seeing his performance, we think that’ll come to fruition. Chunky and Bee Sin were both my ideas for live in players and subs. We needed a player to fill in for HuHi while he flew to and adapted to North America, but more than that, Chunky has proved himself on the ladder.</p>
<p>He’s rank 9 presently, and can really only go up and reach his full capabilities to be one of the best midlaners in North America with the right coaching staff. Bee Sin was also my idea, because he’s the perfect player to fill MakNooN’s shoes and to later train under him. He has a huge amount of latent skill that we can tap into, in addition to being a very mature and social player. He’s acting as a team captain before MakNooN gets here, he’s a leader inside and out of game.</p>
<p><strong>What is your opinion on the roster swaps in the rest of the league (i.e. CRS Piglet)?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wei:</strong> I feel as though roster swaps are the natural direction of how things go and businesses are there to win fiscally. It’s hard to say whether it was a good move or not, because we don’t know the dynamic that happens inside of the Curse Team. If they can support Piglet despite the language barrier, he could be valuable, but beyond that, it’s hard to say. Our focus is developing relationships and a good social environment, which relies on the fact that we believe player’s environment can have a larger impact than raw skill.</p>
<p>On a side note, though, I’m really excited to see the change, just as a fan of Piglet’s play in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Magic:</strong> I think that Curse bringing Piglet over is either going to be a huge step forward, or it may be a huge flop. It depends what Curse does to facilitate Piglet’s transfer. There’s a huge language and cultural barrier and if there isn’t a way for the players and coaches to connect with Piglet, that would be another failed import due to lack of proper infrastructure.</p>
<p>With the somewhat recent flop of Seraph due to all of the language issues, as well as the situation that happened with Edward, we hope that Curse has learned and can make the switch successful. If they can make this import successfully, it will be a huge step forward for their team and the NA scene as a whole. We’re certainly cheering for their success, of course, as the ability to synthesize western and eastern talent will be instrumental in the west winning another world championship soon.</p>
<p><strong>Who do you fear in the expansion tournament?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wei:</strong> As of right now, we’re so new. We aren’t taking anyone lightly in tournament preparation and we’re planning for the possibility of failure – we’ll be in the gaming house no matter what, and you’ll be seeing a lot more of us through the spring challenger series split even if we fail now. We’re the underdogs since we’re so new and have so little time to prepare, but at the same time we don’t fear anyone because the only ones in the way of our success is ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Magic:</strong> No one.</p>
<p><strong>Has anything surprised you about the players?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wei:</strong> I’ve always been on Reddit and there’s a lot of Gleeb haters. To be honest, I was hesitant to work with him. When I met him in real life, though, he blew me away. Nick is incredibly nice and friendly, and his commitment to the team has been astounding – I think the community has the horribly wrong impression of him as a player. I can honestly say I hope to stay friends with everyone on the team for a long time, especially <strong>Gleeb</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Bee</strong> <strong>Sin</strong> was also a huge surprise. He’s very young, but still incredibly well spoken and mature. With both of those players getting specific mention, I have to say the whole team has blown me away with their responsiveness to coaching, positive attitudes, and commitment. Everyone on the team has been so respectful and ready to work with each other.</p>
<p><strong>Magic:</strong> Jae [<strong>HuHi</strong>] came into the house immediately after a flight from Korea and just got on solo queue right away. He has astounded me continually. The team has accepted him so quickly and he’s very social with everyone and communicates well. As soon as the team started playing together, he fit perfectly into the role that Chunky had been holding down in his absence and his synergy after a minimal amount of games is incredible. Everyone has been so friendly with each other immediately, I really look forward to seeing them develop their synergy in the future.</p>

<p>Alden &#8220;<strong>Veyloris</strong>&#8221; Haight is the founder and owner of Fusion eSports. He is relatively new to the scene, and after failing to rescue LMQ from their management troubles he decided to start from scratch and lay the foundation for a new powerhouse organization in NA. Here&#8217;s what he had to say:</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Veyloris &#8211; Team Owner</h4>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Alden-01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-21914 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Alden-01-300x168.jpg" alt="Alden 01" width="525" height="294" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Alden-01-300x168.jpg 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Alden-01-620x348.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Some people have questioned the decision to fly NintendudeX first class. How would you respond to those people? Does the decision reflect the philosophy you bring to the team?</strong></p>
<p>Most of the staff and team were flown first class. It’s sort of a tradition that we’ve always observed. The first flight we book with people we work with is first class. If you book correctly, it’s only a little more expensive and we’ve always looked at it as a symbolic gesture. Y’know? It’s sort of a “welcome to the organization, we’re going to try and take care of you” sort of thing.</p>
<p>Plus, a lot of the players are young. First class is an experience, especially internationally. It’s a fun thing for people to do at least once in their life and it’s a good way to start a professional relationship. If you’ve ever had a bad international flight, you know how hard it is to get off on the right foot with people if you’re tired.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2k4uql/nintendude_confirmed_to_play_with_maknoon_nien/cli2109">reddit</a> that the players were chosen in part for their laid-back attitude and that the team was in it for the long haul. Did you have to make sacrifices of skill when you were choosing players to accommodate this? </strong></p>
<p>Not at all. NA has more talent than people give credit for it, part of the problem is that most teams only offer the same environment. Some players need a healthier social environment in order to thrive. We have a lot of seasoned players, and all of them have experienced internal team issues that have definitely hampered their abilities to perform well. With a management and coaching staff focused on promoting a healthier competitive environment, you <em>will</em> see the skill of the players come out beyond what people might expect from seeing them in the past.</p>
<p><strong>You <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2jxdhd/fusion_gaming_maknoon_nintendude_nien_gleeb_and/clgxltz">hinted</a> at a &#8220;more refined and better implemented&#8221; version of your original plan for LMQ. Are there any details you&#8217;d like to share about this?</strong></p>
<p>In essence, that’s me saying “we didn’t fly to their house with contracts in hand and ask them to sign”. We’ve been able to carefully plan a lot of things that we’ve been developing to support the team and the brand, and all of the planning will come out very clearly when you see our brand and team start to move forward.</p>
<p><strong>You teased in a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2jxdhd/fusion_gaming_maknoon_nintendude_nien_gleeb_and/clgch6d">reddit thread</a> that there&#8217;s a &#8220;few other, cool things that we&#8217;re doing differently that help&#8221;. Care to discuss?</strong></p>
<p>Like I mentioned above, we’re focusing on the personalities and the players, not just who is hyped the most. There’s so many great examples of teams who haven’t made changes to and yet have been able to continue to compete continually on a global scale – Cloud 9 immediately comes to mind.</p>
<p>In addition, we’re trying to break the typical problems of a gaming house by developing more of a gaming complex. We have 3 buildings on the same property, and we’re looking to make sure that there is a distinct aesthetic change between work time and play time for the players. Because of the timing of the team’s creation, we won’t have break until April, so we need to make sure that our setup is mentally sustainable to the players. We want to innovate what a gaming house provides a team by not just allowing the advantage of being able to control schedules, but to allow more freedom for the players to be healthy mentally.</p>
<p>And, as mentioned in a lot of places on Twitter and Reddit, we’re running with a larger support staff. Many teams neglect having the right coaches to guide the players. By no means are coaches just something you can throw at a team to make it better, but if you have the right relationships formed with the team, the coach can help so much in developing untapped talent.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we’re adopting the Korean innovation of practice partners. We have Bee Sin and Chunky in the house with us to be streamers and subs. They’ll both be working closely with MakNooN and Huhi to develop into top tier players. Both are already standout talents from the NA scene, and we’re looking to work symbiotically with them – they’ll help the team improve as they themselves become dominant players, who will later found our challenger/sister team.</p>
<p>There’s a few more things that we have, but more of that will come out later.</p>
<p><strong>The misinformation campaign by BeeSin- your idea or his?</strong></p>
<p>Sleep deprivation was the real MVP on that one, but I stand by it. It’s not the most professional thing to have done in the world, but I think having a little bit of the misinformation hype lead to more interest in our announcement.</p>
<p><strong>How did the process of choosing a coach for the team go? What do you feel like Noblesse brings to the table that other potential candidates did not?</strong></p>
<p>Choosing our coaching staff was something that was very important to me from the start. Noblesse was actually brought to my attention by both Magic and Wei. I had already talked to Wei and Magic and stated I wanted them to work as coaches, but that we needed someone to facilitate the house and the player’s homeostasis. For that, we needed a mature person who understood the game. He’s our ‘everything’, essentially. He’s a great cook and has fantastic game knowledge. He’s able to keep the house running while Magic and Wei sit in on the players’ solo queue, scrims or 5s.</p>
<p>It’s hard to find someone who is mature enough to know what a house needs to keep running and who also is able to contribute at the highest level of game knowledge. As soon as I realized what he could bring to the team as far as flexibility, I wanted him immediately.</p>
<p><strong>How hard has it been to find sponsors and backers for the new team?</strong></p>
<p>That’s an interesting question. At the moment, I am the money for the team. We have a business team that is working with sponsors, so we’re confident you’ll be seeing some names on our uniform after we enter the LCS. We’re committing a lot of resources to the team, so we’re not in need of small sponsorships to get on our feet.</p>
<p>We’re basically looking for the big fish after the team is more popular, or after they make the LCS. To help with that, we have a studio and media guy working from in the house to develop content far better than many league outlets can provide. I’m not sure how many sponsors <em>don’t</em> want us developing fantastic in-house sponsorships for their brand. With that said, any inquiries about sponsorships can be forwarded to <a href="mailto:aldenhaight@gmail.com">aldenhaight@gmail.com</a> / <a href="mailto:esmith.casual@gmail.com">esmith.casual@gmail.com</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000;">Video games are close to all of our hearts &#8211; Whether our first experience was on a GameBoy or an N64, many of us can recall fond memories of time spent gaming since childhood. I had never imagined a world where competitive gaming would be occurring on a global scale for millions of players to enjoy and share &#8211; Yet here we are: As a League of Legends player since Season 2, it has been incredible to see the rise of eSports and the amount of passion and talent showcased from all around the world. What kinds of changes will we see in the eSports industry as we move into yet another year and the competition and opportunities continue to grow?</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>Andrew Pallet, owner of Darevolt.com and a spirited gamer, has graciously offered some thoughts on the state of eSports. I hope you&#8217;ll take a read and listen of what he has to say and share your thoughts as well!</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21730" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Header3.jpg" alt="Header3" width="620" height="130" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Header3.jpg 620w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Header3-300x62.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Depending on how old you are, your first experience of competitive gaming will be very different. It could be as simple as booting your PC and joining a game online, or it might involve lugging your whole rig round to your friend’s house and spending what seemed like forever connecting wires before getting to the good stuff. Or just playing a console, but that ruins my comparison.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Fast forward a few years (for me at least) and video games are now a huge cultural phenomenon, with eSports leading the charge.</p>
<hr />
<h5 style="color: #000000; text-align: right;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><em>Now more than ever it seems like people want to discuss eSports – Twitch got bought by Amazon, what does this mean? Are eSports comparable to athletic sports?</em></span></h5>
<hr />
<p style="color: #000000; text-align: left;">I spoke with my friend, eSports organizer and pro Hearthstone player Alex Baguley about eSports in the UK and beyond. Take a look:</p>
<p><div class="wpdev-youtube-container">

		<div class="wpdev-rollover wpdev-facebook">
		<a class="pw-button-facebook pw-look-native pw-size-xlarge"></a>

		</div></div><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/NKbjluizulc?rel=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">We talked about a lot and you should definitely check it out (shameless plug over). I wanted to say a lot more about eSports, which I hope I’ll be able to do in future episodes, but I’ll make a start here.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">As the video games industry continues to grow (let’s not forget it’s still growing – Faster than other entertainment mediums I might add), there are going to be a few key moments which define their standards over the longer term. One I like to joke about is Action/RPG characters eating a McDonald&#8217;s Big Mac to regain health instead of a generic food-looking thing.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21643 size-large" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/15248010027_0d05d32b9b_k-620x412.jpg" alt="15248010027_0d05d32b9b_k" width="620" height="412" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/15248010027_0d05d32b9b_k-620x412.jpg 620w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/15248010027_0d05d32b9b_k-300x199.jpg 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/15248010027_0d05d32b9b_k-330x220.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">We’ve seen from The International over the years that prize money has been able to attract more attention for DotA 2 compared to League of Legends, even though League has a much larger player base. Obviously, Valve has a bit of cash kicking around to throw at the game and the compendium was a pretty smart business move.</p>
<hr />
<h5 style="color: #000000; text-align: right;"><em><span style="color: #ff6600;">If money is the main driver, though, do we run the risk of eSports becoming a shouting match? Whoever can bag the advertisers with the deepest pockets wins?</span></em></h5>
<hr />
<p style="color: #000000;">Right now, I don’t think it’s that big of a deal. People are still figuring it out, dipping a toe in and waiting to see how things are going forward. It’s still a very young form of sports, let’s not forget. <a href="http://steelseries.com/us/products/surfaces/steelseries-qck-limited-edition-fnatic" target="_blank"><img class="alignright wp-image-21647 size-medium" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/productpage_qckfnatic_big-300x160.png" alt="productpage_qckfnatic_big" width="300" height="160" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/productpage_qckfnatic_big-300x160.png 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/productpage_qckfnatic_big-620x330.png 620w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/productpage_qckfnatic_big.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Adverts right now seem to be in a good place – GIF&#8217;s on player’s twitch streams don’t really distract from the gameplay, and adverts in between matches are essentially the same as watching TV. Even product placement makes more sense than it does in the music or film industries because the players actually need to use keyboards, mice and all the other peripherals to play their games.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">What is my point? I don’t know. I ramble. These are just some thoughts I wanted to get out there so people can talk about them – that’s kind of the whole point of the videos I’m doing. Agree, disagree – It doesn’t matter. Open conversation will be the key to the success of eSports, as long as it’s constructive. That’s kind of a point, right?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With season four wrapping up in the next month or so, I figured I would help out my fellow low-elo buds!</p>
<p><em>Elo Hell</em>. The words send a shiver through me. The term, for those who don&#8217;t know, usually references the situation a summoner is in when it comes to their ranked tier/class. The general argument is that &#8220;I&#8217;m not a bad player, my team is; ergo I&#8217;m in Elo Hell. My actual MMR is wrong and I should be higher placed.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is just an excuse players tend to make because it is easier to point the finger at others than admit there is a problem. <em>Elo Hell</em> doesn&#8217;t actually exist. If you are such a great player as you claim, then naturally you should win more games, progressing up the ladder.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21736 size-large" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/15835-620x322.jpg" alt="15835" width="620" height="322" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/15835-620x322.jpg 620w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/15835-300x156.jpg 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/15835.jpg 1103w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>Firstly, some background information on me and why I&#8217;m writing this article. I got into League of Legends back during season one. My roommate at the time suggested I give it a try and I’ve been playing off and on since. It’s only been since halfway through season three that I tried to climb the ranked ladder.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21735 size-full" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image-17.jpg" alt="image-17" width="620" height="103" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image-17.jpg 620w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image-17-300x49.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>As far as I wanted to succeed, I was placed into bronze tier. I was upset at first since the majority of my friends were all in or around silver II. I consider my skills to be similar to theirs, so being placed in bronze was a slap in the face. After climbing and dropping I went from bronze 1 to 4 and ended the season in bronze 3.</p>
<p>I had failed to achieve my goal before the season ended and, to be frank, I was angry with my performance.</p>
<p>With the start of season four, I was eager to see where my placement matches would land me. I ended up going 7-3 and placed into bronze 1. Again my frustration was there.</p>
<p>However, I decided to attempt to channel that frustration and use it as fuel to improve. I changed my goal of wanting to get gold to simply climb out of bronze. Using the tips below, I was successful in advancing to silver tier!</p>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-09-16-at-4.51.58-PM.png"><img class=" wp-image-21653 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-09-16-at-4.51.58-PM-620x387.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-09-16 at 4.51.58 PM" width="541" height="338" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-09-16-at-4.51.58-PM-620x387.png 620w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-09-16-at-4.51.58-PM-300x187.png 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-09-16-at-4.51.58-PM.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" /></a></p>
<p>I’ve looked up various guides on how to escape <em>Elo Hell</em> and have created a list of things that were helpful on my journey out of bronze. Some of them pertain to in-game skills, while others related to my mindset or health.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Tips</h3>
<hr />
<p><strong>Control:</strong></p>
<p>League of Legends is filled with many variables that contribute to whether your team wins or loses. But at the end of the day, the only controllable variable is yourself. Raging at your team doesn’t go anywhere. Focus your energy on what you can do to help your team.</p>
<p>Can you roam to help a struggling lane?<br />
Can you place an extra ward if you know your jungler is constantly getting counter-jungled?<br />
Can you help out to secure objectives for your team?</p>

<p><strong>Power Poses</strong>:</p>
<p>Here is an interesting video I discovered a while ago. I found it intriguing that the small things outside of the game could affect my in-game results. I would also suggest checking out the TED talk that gbay references. This is a video that could possibly impact you beyond just League.</p>
<p>Usually during the load screen, I’ll sit with my hands behind my head and lean back in my chair. I&#8217;ve found myself being slightly more confident going into matches. I&#8217;m not suggesting that you will guarantee a win every game after trying to use power poses. But it will definitely help you relax and get ready for the game.</p>

<p><strong>M</strong><strong>indset:  </strong></p>
<p>Walk into lane with the mentality that you own it. If you ever watch Dyrus stream, he’ll sometimes say “Get the hell out of my lane.” Now this may sound possessive but Dyrus is making a power statement. This sort of ties into what I was saying about power poses, but pertains more to the mental aspect.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if Dyrus actually practices power poses before a game. During regional playoffs, Dyrus was able to get a kill 1v1 versus LMQ&#8217;s Ackerman and displayed his emotions. I was attending PAX at the time and was watching the games. The moment that this particular play went down, the crowd went nuts! Watching this and the other games live motivated me to want to improve.</p>
<p><strong>Now how does this translate into your solo-queue games?</strong></p>
<p>Well, go into lane saying this is your lane and you&#8217;re here to show the enemy who is in charge. Don&#8217;t take needless damage unless it yields a result. Sometimes when I&#8217;m playing support, I&#8217;ll attack the enemy laners as soon as they walk into lane. I&#8217;m saying, &#8220;Hey! I&#8217;m not here to just sit around and farm. I&#8217;m here to show you who is in charge.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Wards:</strong></p>
<p>Vision is one of the most important aspects of League of Legends. The whole team should be contributing to overall vision control. This is especially important around the mid game where teams go for dragon or baron. Is your support not warding enough? Then you should buy extra wards to help. Some games, I had to buy a Sightstone when I was jungling to make up for vision control. It actually worked out pretty well. Even when I’m playing marksman, I’ll pick up a ward when I recall.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mechward.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-18737 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mechward-620x197.jpg" alt="mechward" width="620" height="197" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mechward-620x197.jpg 620w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mechward-300x95.jpg 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mechward.jpg 1413w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a><strong>Objectives: </strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s very important to know when your team can get objectives such as dragon. If you can get a kill or two bot, call your jungler down to go for an early dragon. If you are going to go for an objective without having the numbers advantage, then it&#8217;s even more crucial to keep control over vision. Always use a sweeper or ward around the objective to know if an enemy is approaching.</p>
<p><strong>Music: </strong></p>
<p>Having the right music playing can help motivate your game. Personally I recommend downloading the Spotify app for your computer. There are tons of playlists already created to save time having to start from scratch. I usually listen to some Electronic Dance Music when I’m playing ranked. It gets me hyped up and gives me an energy boost to boot.</p>
<p><strong>Breathe and t</strong><strong>ake b</strong><strong>reaks</strong>:</p>
<p>Between matches, I usually get out of my chair and stretch my legs for 5-10 minutes. Sometimes I would walk my dog in between matches, or just go sit outside for a little bit. It’ll allow you to reset mentally and take the stress off from the last game.</p>
<p><strong>Get Carried: </strong></p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to let yourself get carried. Everyone has a bad game once in a while so instead of just saying <em>GG</em> five minutes into a game, decide to help those on your team that are doing great. If I’m playing a role I’m not the best at and feed, I try to not go on tilt. Say your jungler is doing great, I’ll let him make calls and follow. League is all about working together towards a common goal &#8212; victory!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rumble has been a major talking point at the 2014 World Championship &#8212; Ever since he emerged as a successful counter to the previously dominant Maokai in the opening game between<strong> Korea&#8217;s Samsung White</strong> and <strong>China&#8217;s Edward Gaming.</strong></p>
<p><em>However, he&#8217;s not a simple pick</em>, and if you&#8217;ve not spent some time mastering the champion (he has the 6th most deaths of any champion at Worlds) <em>you&#8217;re likely to have a bad time.</em> So let&#8217;s dive into how the pros play Rumble by looking at his performance in the World Championship.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19844 size-full" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Fridgecake.png" alt="Fridgecake" width="690" height="130" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Fridgecake.png 690w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Fridgecake-300x56.png 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Fridgecake-620x116.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Worlds Pick/Ban Numbers</h2>
<p>Rumble was played 15 times in the Group stages and banned an additional six times, giving him a Group participation in 42% of the total games.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21738" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rumble-Stats.jpg" alt="Rumble-Stats" width="596" height="352" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rumble-Stats.jpg 620w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rumble-Stats-300x177.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /></p>
<p>He was commonly viewed as a <strong>counter pick to Maokai</strong>, facing off against the Twisted Treant in lane seven times in the Group stages and an additional three times in the Quarterfinals.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to say whether Rumble is actually a counter to Maokai in a 5v5 environment, because you have the rest of your team available to make up for any potential weaknesses as well as lane swaps to contend with.</p>
<p>However, in solo queue, Rumble does well against Maokai because he&#8217;s got great sustained damage from a very early level. He can bully Maokai during his weak pre-Rod of Ages phase and he can follow Maokai&#8217;s incredibly strong level six teleport with his own devastating Ultimate. Additionally, as we&#8217;ll see a bit later, Rumble&#8217;s main item (Liandry&#8217;s Torment) synergizes very well against Maokai&#8217;s first item purchase.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Worlds Match-Ups</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rumble is primarily being used as a counter or a deterrent to <strong>Maokai,</strong> but he has also seen success against Lulu, Ryze and Kayle.</p>
<p><strong>With 12 wins from 21 picks, he holds a 52% win rate</strong>, which isn&#8217;t <em>that</em> high, and he is actually <strong>4-6 </strong>against Maokai at Worlds.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21767" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/rumbleVS.png" alt="rumbleVS" width="558" height="165" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/rumbleVS.png 558w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/rumbleVS-300x88.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px" /></p>
<p>Rumble&#8217;s best match-ups are against Kayle and Lulu, boasting a 4-0 and 2-0 win rate respectively, while he has a losing win rate against Ryze at 2-3.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: right;"></h5>
<hr />
<h5 style="text-align: right;"><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"><em>Ironically, it&#8217;s actually better to pick Maokai AGAINST Rumble, based on these stats</em></span></strong></h5>
<hr />
<h5 style="text-align: right;"></h5>
<p>Balls and Ackerman have played The Mechanized Menace the most with four games each, both going <strong>2-2</strong>, while TSM&#8217;s Dyrus and SSB&#8217;s Acorn are the only players to play more than one game and win them all with two wins each.</p>
<p><strong>Rumble has been banned 11 times at Worlds.</strong> <strong>Dyrus</strong> has drawn the largest number of bans on him with <strong>five</strong>, including all <strong>four</strong> Quarterfinal match-ups against SSW, while Balls only drew a single ban, despite his perfect record with the champion coming into the World Championship.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Runes</h2>
<p>Looking at all of the games played in the Group stages and Quarterfinals, we can see some patterns emerge with the pro&#8217;s rune choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote><p>The Pros pick <strong>Magic Penetration Marks</strong> <span style="color: #993300;"><strong>(Reds)</strong></span> &#8212; Except for one game by AHQ Prydz (4x Mpen, 5x Hybrid Pen)</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>They pick <strong>Defensive Seals <span style="color: #ff9900;">(Yellows) <span style="color: #000000;">&#8212; </span></span></strong><span style="color: #ff9900;"><span style="color: #000000;">No</span></span>rmally Armour, Health, Armour Per Level or HP Per Level</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>They almost exclusively run <strong>flat MR Glyphs </strong><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>(Blues)</strong>. &#8212;</span> Balls ran AP/Level once against Samsung Blue</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>They always run <strong>AP <span style="color: #808080;">Quints</span></strong></p></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 style="text-align: right;"></h5>
<hr />
<h5 style="text-align: right;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><em>What this means for you, as a player, is that you can tailor your Seals and Glyphs to the champions you are facing in lane, but should focus your Marks and Quints towards aggression</em></span></h5>
<hr />
<h5 style="text-align: right;"></h5>
<div id="attachment_21696" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-21696" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rumble-Rune-Page-at-Worlds-620x362.png" alt="The most common Rumble rune page at worlds" width="690" height="403" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rumble-Rune-Page-at-Worlds-620x362.png 620w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rumble-Rune-Page-at-Worlds-300x175.png 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rumble-Rune-Page-at-Worlds.png 822w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><strong>The most common Rumble rune page at Worlds</strong></p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Masteries</h2>
<p>Rumble works best running <strong>21/9/0</strong> masteries, though there was an isolated case in which Balls played 9/21/0 against Kayle.</p>
<h4>Defensive Masteries</h4>
<p>Most Rumbles take the same 9 defensive points:</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-21698 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rumble-Defensive-Masteries-at-Worlds.png" alt="Rumble Defensive Masteries at Worlds" width="268" height="475" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rumble-Defensive-Masteries-at-Worlds.png 268w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rumble-Defensive-Masteries-at-Worlds-169x300.png 169w" sizes="(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px" /></p>
<p><strong>These are the best points you can invest in this tree to increase your early survivability.</strong></p>
<p>It might seem effective to take enchanted armor, but realistically, you aren&#8217;t going to be <strong>building</strong> a large number of resistances so the <b>bonus</b> resistances granted by this mastery won&#8217;t actually amount to much.</p>
<h4>Offensive Masteries</h4>
<p>There is some debate to the most effective offensive masteries for Rumble, but they mostly end up similar to the following build (Note you need more points in the tree than i&#8217;ve listed, see below):</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-21701 aligncenter" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rumble-Offensive-Masteries-at-Worlds.png" alt="Rumble Offensive Masteries at Worlds" width="274" height="472" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rumble-Offensive-Masteries-at-Worlds.png 274w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rumble-Offensive-Masteries-at-Worlds-174x300.png 174w" sizes="(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px" /></p>
<p>This is a fairly core set of points for an ability champion and helps promote the early game with early AP and cooldown reduction, as well as increasing late-game damage with %AP and %Penetration.</p>
<p>However it&#8217;s the points off of the core of the trees that have provided the variation between different players:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can be argued that Double Edged Sword is a weak mastery for Rumble given that he is short ranged, so he will likely take the extra 1% damage, but it is a large increase in damage. The other choices are more up to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> playstyle. If you have trouble last hitting with Rumble you can pick up Butcher/Feast or try to abuse your early killing power to sustain yourself through teamfights with Dangerous Game.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Item Builds</h2>
<h4>Starting Items</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21716" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rumble-Start-Items-Worlds.png" alt="Rumble Start Items Worlds" width="247" height="97" />Most of the pro players started with Doran&#8217;s Shield &#8212; However, Dyrus, Balls and sOAZ went for a Ruby Crystal start in four games. The decision to do this seems to be playstyle<strong> </strong>based, as sOAZ and Balls picked both a Doran&#8217;s Shield and a Ruby Crystal start against Maokai and Kayle.</p>
<p>Doran&#8217;s Shield gives you a stronger early game before your first back, but will delay your Haunting Guise &#8212; Which is a considerable power spike in lane.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Boots</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18565" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sorcerers_Shoes_item.png" alt="Sorcerer's_Shoes_item" width="64" height="64" /></p>
<p>Sorcerer&#8217;s Shoes. They were build by EVERY Rumble player at worlds.</p>
<hr />
<h4>First Item</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-11516" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Haunting_Guise_item.png" alt="Haunting_Guise_item" width="64" height="64" /></p>
<p>Every single player built a Haunting Guise as their first item regardless of what item they were building next. It provides everything Rumble is looking for and makes him a very potent duelist in lane.</p>
<p>After this there was some build variation, but it provides a good point about Rumble.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: right;"></h5>
<hr />
<h5 style="text-align: right;"><em><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>After completing his Haunting Guise, Rumble can build for his team</strong></span></em></h5>
<hr />
<h5 style="text-align: right;"></h5>
<ul>
<li>If your team needs the damage or you are planning on bullying your lane opponent, build your Guise into a <strong>Liandry&#8217;s Torment</strong>. This was the most popular build with <strong>11 of the 21 games</strong> seeing a first item Liandry&#8217;s.</li>
<li>If there are strong AD threats, like Zed, Yasuo or Rengar, then build a <strong>Zhonya&#8217;s Hourglass</strong>. This was the second most popular build &#8212; with <strong>5 of the 21 games</strong> seeing Zhonya&#8217;s first.</li>
<li>If the enemy are running a double AP comp, then you can build <strong>Abyssal Sceptre</strong>. Only three games saw a first item Abyssal Sceptre.</li>
<li>There was a single case of Rylai&#8217;s Crystal Sceptre first, but I wouldn&#8217;t advise it.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4>Second and Third Items</h4>
<p>After completing <strong>Liandry&#8217;s Torment,</strong> most pro players went for a Zhonya&#8217;s Hourglass followed by a Void Staff. This is the offensive core of Rumble and allows him, and his ult, to destroy teamfights.</p>
<p>If you started <b>Zhonya&#8217;s Hourglass,</b> then the pros would advise a Rylai&#8217;s next, followed by a Liandry&#8217;s. As a word of caution: There weren&#8217;t a lot of games that went Zhonya&#8217;s first and those that did were usually quite early losses, so they therefore tended to build additional tankiness rather than damage. Zhonya&#8217;s into Liandry&#8217;s is still a strong build if you&#8217;re ahead but you should be gunning for a Liandry&#8217;s first.</p>
<p>Following the <strong>Abyssal Sceptre</strong> route, always lead to a second item: Liandry&#8217;s Torment and then on to a Zhonyas/Rylai&#8217;s, depending on the team composition.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: right;"></h5>
<hr />
<h5 style="text-align: right;"><em><span style="color: #ff6600;">Always keep in mind the other team&#8217;s build. Void Staff is a HUGE damage increase against MR.</span></em></h5>
<hr />
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Rumble is back and he is burning up the competition &#8212; Though he is still struggling to win games against the powerful Maokai. He is primarily used to counter Maokai or dissuade a Maokai pick, giving his team significant strength during the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/worlds-group-c-statistics-numbers-behind-group-death/" target="_blank">crucial 10-15 minute window</a></strong></span>. Use this time to your advantage and snowball for the win.</p>
<p>The pros are in agreement about many things concerning Rumble, like his runes and masteries. However, he has enough small niche parts to his early game, like seals, that allow some customisation to show skill with the champion and separate the good from the great players.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget Rumble needs <strong>a lot of practice</strong>, to maximise your damage with Flamespitter, learning how to use his abilities to last hit under the turret and manage his &#8216;Heat&#8217; mechanic. I wouldn&#8217;t dive straight into ranked games and expect to be able to counter Maokai from the first moment in lane.</p>

<ul>
<li>Great ult at <strong>24:13</strong> to do damage to Lulu and stop her escape (helped by Noname&#8217;s kick)</li>
<li>Great Rumble ult at <strong>29:12</strong> that helps zone Fnatic from the fight to kill Fnatic&#8217;s jungler and secure the dragon.</li>
<li><strong>39:30</strong> shows a brilliant follow up on Mor&#8217;s hook from the whole of LMQ, locking people down on the Rumble ult</li>

<p><em><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Keep in mind that all of these changes are tentative. Numbers, especially, are not set in stone.</strong></span></em></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Balance Changes</h3>
<hr />
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>New Game Mode: Twisted Treeline Hexakill</strong></h4>
<p>The Hexakill game mode is coming to the Twisted Treeline! I haven&#8217;t personally played this new mode, but it sounds absolutely hectic! The Hexakill mode on Summoner&#8217;s Rift wasn&#8217;t too different from normal modes. However, the Twisted Treeline is a much smaller map, and cramming in double the normal amount of champions is going to be interesting, to say the least. Check out TT Hexakill sometime this next patch cycle!</p>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/hexakill.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-21606 size-large" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/hexakill-620x331.jpg" alt="hexakill" width="620" height="331" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/hexakill-620x331.jpg 620w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/hexakill-300x160.jpg 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/hexakill.jpg 815w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<h4>Champion Balances</h4>
<h5>Sion, The Undead Juggernaut &#8211; Re-Release</h5>
<p>It&#8217;s been a long, long road, but the much-awaited Sion rework has finally arrived. Sion has been an awful champion for quite some time now, because of the extremely toxic kit of AP Sion having to be nerfed into obscurity to keep him balanced.</p>
<p>Sion&#8217;s new kit has turned him into a tanky fighter with heaps of CC and some HP damage scaling to boot, and he&#8217;s received a brand-new appearance. He&#8217;s geared towards being either a top laner or a jungler and, from what I can see, he&#8217;s pretty capable of doing both effectively. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at what the new Sion has to offer.</p>
<h4><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Sion_Square.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-21600" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Sion_Square.jpg" alt="Sion_Square" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Sion_Square.jpg 120w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Sion_Square-75x75.jpg 75w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Sion_Square-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a>Base Stats</strong></h4>
<ul style="color: #444444;">
<ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>HP:</strong> 420 (+70 per level)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>HP Regen Per Second:</strong> 1.7 (+.2 per level)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Mana:</strong> 200 (+45 per level)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Mana Regen Per Second:</strong> 1.4 (+0.12 per level)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Attack Range:</strong> 150</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Damage:</strong> 53 (+4 per level)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Armor:</strong> 18 (+3 per level)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Magic Resist:</strong> 30 (+1.25 per level)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Movement Speed:</strong> 345</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sion&#8217;s base stats are actually a bit low, in particular his defensive stats.</strong> His HP, HP per level, armor and HP regen are all definitely on the low side of the spectrum. However, he gets free HP from killing minions like he used to, so honestly this is much less of a deal than it seems. His AD is pretty good though, and his AD scaling per level is only lower than two other champions.</p>
<p>He does have mana and relatively low mana costs with his attacks. As long as you don&#8217;t spam his abilities on cooldown, the mana-gating isn&#8217;t too badly felt. In the jungle Sion can use Q and often W on most camps with a Spirit Stone or a Quill Coat, but in the top lane he needs to be more conscious about using his spells at the right time.</p>
<h4><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sio-passive.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-21601" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sio-passive.png" alt="sio-passive" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sio-passive.png 256w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sio-passive-150x150.png 150w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sio-passive-75x75.png 75w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sio-passive-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a>Passive: Glory in Death</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: left;"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>After being killed Sion will reanimate himself, but his Health rapidly decays while he is reanimated. </em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: left;"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>He can move and attack during this time. He gains 100% Lifesteal, attacks extremely fast and will deal an additional 10% of his target&#8217;s maximum Health on hit. Max 75 bonus damage against monsters. </em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px; text-align: left;"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>All of his abilities are replaced with Death Surge, which grants him a burst of Movement Speed.</em></span></p>
<p><strong>Sion&#8217;s new passive is pretty damn awesome. Upon dying he turns into an enraged version of himself that doesn&#8217;t have any of his old spells, but gains a huge amount of bonus damage and lifesteal.</strong> His health decays very quickly so, unless he attacks someone, he won&#8217;t stick around for too long. It does enable him to have a pretty good chance at getting revenge kills on opponents that manage to take him down.</p>
<p>The craziest thing about this new passive is the lack of a cooldown; Sion can use this every time he dies. However, unlike the passives of Zac and Aatrox, Sion can&#8217;t save himself. Like Karthus, if you kill him,<em> he&#8217;s dead</em>, but he can make you pay for it if you stick around.</p>
<h4><strong><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sio-q.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-21602" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sio-q.png" alt="sio-q" width="64" height="64" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sio-q.png 256w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sio-q-150x150.png 150w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sio-q-75x75.png 75w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sio-q-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 64px) 100vw, 64px" /></a>Q: Decimating Smash</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>50/55/60/65/70 Mana</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #808080;"> <em> 10/9/8/7/6 Second CD </em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>Sion charges up a heavy blow for up to 2 seconds. When released, he deals 20/40/60/80/100 (+.6 total AD) to 60/120/180/240/300 (+1.8 total AD) physical damage to enemies in the area (60% damage to minions). Enemies hit are briefly slowed. </em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><span style="color: #808080;">If Sion charges for at least 1 second, enemies are knocked up and stunned for 1.25 to 2.25 seconds.</span> </em></p>
<p>Sion&#8217;s Q is a charge-and-release AoE nuke with great range and CC applications. Not only does it pack a wallop if charged, but it knocks up and stuns enemies caught in its considerable area if he charges it for at least half of the charge time.</p>
<p>Decimating Smash is a useful clearing tool if you decide to jungle, as well as a great way to catch opponents to follow up on poor positioning. The downside is that it isn&#8217;t as great at extremely close range, since your opponent can walk behind you to dodge it (Katarina especially causes problems here). If you can land the knockup, though, it makes a fantastic trade tool in top lane and a great ganking setup tool for junglers.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>70/75/80/85/90 Mana</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #808080;"> <em>13 Second CD </em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>Passive: Sion gains 2 maximum health whenever he kills a unit (8 for large monster and champion kill or assist). </em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>Active: Sion shields himself for 30/55/80/95/110 (+.4 AP) (10% of maximum Health) for 6 seconds. After 2 seconds, while the shield holds Sion can reactivate to deal 40/65/90/105/120 (+.4 AP) plus 10/11/12/13/14/15% of the target&#8217;s maximum health as magic damage to enemies around himself. Max 400 bonus damage against minions and monsters. </em></span></p>
<p>Soul Furnace is the least changed aspect of Sion&#8217;s kit. Its passive aspect gives him free health for farming up. Normally this kind of mechanic would prevent a champion from jungling too effectively, as they wouldn&#8217;t be able to keep up stats. However, every large jungle monster counts for four smaller minions, so it balances out pretty nicely. This passive makes Spirit of the Ancient Golem a pretty powerful item on Sion, due to the 25% bonus health it gives.</p>
<p>The active effect is familiar to any old Sion players. It places a shield on Sion for six seconds that he can detonate after two seconds to deal damage in an AoE around him. The shield is much weaker at base values than it used to be and doesn&#8217;t scale nearly as much off AP anymore. However, it does scale off Sion&#8217;s maximum health, which is great news since he gets health for free. It also deals less damage than it used to but now scales with a percentage of the enemy&#8217;s health.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>25 Mana</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #808080;"> <em>12/11/10/9/8 Second CD </em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>Sion fires a short range shockwave, dealing 70/105/140/175/210 (+.4 AP) magic damage to the first target hit, slowing it by 40/45/50/55/60%, and reducing its armor by 20% for 2.5 seconds. </em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>If the target is not a champion, they will be knocked back. All enemies that the knocked back unit passes through will take 50% bonus damage and be slowed by  40/45/50/55/60%.</em></span></p>
<p>Roar of the Slayer is a missile that puts both a slow and an armor shred on the first unit it hits. It&#8217;s pretty useful for long-range harass to slow someone down so that you can hit them with your Q.</p>
<p>It also has really interesting interaction with minions. If the missile hits a minion, the minion is knocked back pretty far, as well as any other units it passes through. This can be used for wave clearing or for knocking away the creeps in top lane so that you can harass without taking as much minion damage.</p>

<h4><strong><img class="alignleft" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1_sio-r.png" alt="" width="65" height="65" />Ultimate: Unstoppable Onsaught</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>100 Mana</em></span><br />
<span style="color: #808080;"> <em>140/100/60 Second CD </em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>Sion charges in a direction for 8 seconds and can steer slowly towards the mouse cursor. While charging, Sion is immune to all Crowd Control. Reactivating will cancel Sion&#8217;s charge early.  </em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>When Sion collides with an enemy champion or wall, he deals 150/300/450 (+.4 bonus AD) physical damage and knocks up and stuns enemies in a small area for 0.75 seconds. Enemies in a larger area take the same damage and have their Movement Speed slowed by 40/45/50% for 3 seconds.  </em></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #808080;"><em>The damage increases to 300/600/900 (+.8 bonus AD) and the stun duration increases to 1.75 seconds as Sion charges further. </em></span></p>
<p>Sion&#8217;s new ultimate is, in my opinion, the most fun part of his new kit. Unstoppable Onslaught (or as I like to call it, the Pain Train) causes Sion to charge in the direction of your cursor until he hits a champion or a wall. When he makes his collision, he does damage in an AoE, knocks up and stuns everything in a small area, and slows everything in a slightly larger area. The damage and stun duration increase the further Sion travels.</p>
<p>This ability has potentially devastating engage potential. It doesn&#8217;t take too long for Sion to ramp up speed so, if he begins his charge in the fog of war, he&#8217;ll come in like a wrecking ball and smash into the enemy. He can then follow up with his Q for a stun lock on anyone that the ultimate made contact with. It&#8217;s great for starting teamfights or for ganking unsuspecting laners.</p>
<p>The only problem with this ultimate is that, while it does steer towards your cursor, it does so very, very slowly. This can lead to some <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2bHDj7Ft7A" target="_blank">pretty bad misses</a></strong></span> if your opponent reacts fast enough to dodge you. <strong><em>Practice</em> this before you go into a ranked queue, everybody.</strong></p>

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Akali has become a little bit more dominant in recent weeks. Her W, Twilight Shroud, enables her to attack and then vanish back into stealth if she&#8217;s fighting on it, but it also makes her tankier. This leads to her being extremely hard to kill when combined with her natural sustain.</p>
<p>To fix this problem, the resistances are no longer granted by Twilight Shroud. Instead, Akali is now faster inside it. The speed bonus is fairly negligible at first but gets pretty high later in the game. This is an interesting change because it should make Akali better at killing but easier to kill.</p>

<p>Emperor Azir is getting a tiny balance change. There were some tweaks to his armor and mana regen earlier in the cycle, but they ended up getting reverted. Azir has shown promise but has a bit too much early-game weakness that can cripple him if exploited. This change, while small, should hopefully make his level 1-3 a bit smoother.</p>

<p>Ezreal has been pretty marginalised as a marksmen for a while now, since he gets outclassed by higher-damage opponents. These buffs should make his kill potential a bit higher without making him too annoying to fight.</p>

</ul>
</ul>
<p>Yar, har, fiddle dee dee. Gangplank is, in my opinion, a really fun champion that&#8217;s unfortunately crippled by a few glaring problems. One of these problems is the lack of consistency in his ultimate, Cannon Barrage. It&#8217;s a great long-range zone tool that can really swing a fight if used properly. However, the damage is done at random points within the circle, so sometimes an enemy can just walk out without taking a single hit.</p>
<p>These changes should make Cannon Barrage much more reliable in terms of damage with the damage being done across the whole circle at once. This attack is going to have really high teamfight-swinging potential, which is great news for the Saltwater Scourge.</p>

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m always conflicted when Kha&#8217;Zix gets nerfed. On one hand, he can really dominate the meta when he&#8217;s strong and bully out other champions from being picked. On the other hand, I just love playing him so damn much.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even I need to agree that he gets a bit too much free poke right now, especially when leveling W first. This change will hopefully tone down that long-range harass a bit without making him unusable.</p>

</ul>
</ul>
<p>Lucian is almost balanced, but he&#8217;s still a bit too strong. This patch will limit his free escape and mobility by putting an early mana cap on it. Engaging on Lucian when he&#8217;s out of mana will actually be a much more reliable way to secure a kill.</p>

<p><em>Finally! </em>Tristana has been far too strong for far too long, to the point of having win rates over 70% in competitive play and being consistently banned in solo queue. She&#8217;s been nerfed little by little in a few patches over the last few months, but none of the nerfs have really impacted her dominance in any real way.</p>
<p>This time, though, it should stick. Her attack speed per level is being smacked with the nerf bat and the duration on her steroid Q lowered by 2 seconds. Her Q is more effective at later levels to compensate but these changes will go a long way to bringing Tristana down to the levels of the mortal marksmen.</p>

<p>Yasuo has also been pretty strong for a while and is being nerfed over the course of several patches. He&#8217;s not quite where he should be, so this patch is making him squishier at level 1 and slower by 10 points. These changes should make his level 1 less devastating and make him easier to nail down as he zips around the battlefield.</p>

<h4>Item Balances</h4>
<h4><strong>Randuin&#8217;s Omen</strong></h4>
<div style="color: #444444;">
<ul>
<li><b>Passive: Cold Steel </b>attack speed slow <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>increased</strong></span> to <strong>15%</strong> from 10%</li>
</ul>
<p>Patch 4.10 nerfed Randuin&#8217;s Omen by removing the movement speed slow on hit and taking the attack speed slow down from 15% to 10%. Randuin&#8217;s was pretty dominant in its day, but the emergence of attack-speed hypercarries like Tristana has made the nerf pretty sorely felt.</p>
<p>The cold steel effect is being brought back up to previous levels but the movement-speed slow is staying off, which should keep Randuin&#8217;s from being at its old state.</p>

<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/new_leesin.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-21593" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/new_leesin-620x365.jpg" alt="new_leesin" width="620" height="365" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/new_leesin-620x365.jpg 620w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/new_leesin-300x177.jpg 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/new_leesin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<h4><strong>Texture Rebalancing</strong></h4>
<p>The Texture Rebalancing initiative continues! Blitzcrank, Brand, Evelynn, Graves&#8217; Hired Gun skin, Nocturne, and Olaf are receiving new textures in this patch. The Blitzcrank and Nocturne ones look especially awesome.</p>

<h4><strong>Anivia&#8217;s Flash Frost VFX</strong></h4>
<p>Anivia&#8217;s Q has received a better animation as well as a ring indicator to show its range as the missile flies.</p>
<p><a href="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/aniv_q.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-21599" src="http://cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/aniv_q-620x196.jpg" alt="aniv_q" width="620" height="196" srcset="http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/aniv_q-620x196.jpg 620w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/aniv_q-300x95.jpg 300w, http://cdn.cloth5.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/aniv_q.jpg 1593w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></a></p>
<h4><strong>Ping and Ambience Volume</strong></h4>
<p>Two new volume options have been added to the menu. We can now turn down ambient sounds (which there are a few more of in the new Summoner&#8217;s Rift), and turn down the volume of pings.</p>
<h4><strong>Character Inking Option</strong></h4>
<p>A new graphical option has been added to draw a dark line around character borders. This might make it a little easier to keep track of champions during teamfights.</p>
