                <![CDATA[<p>Chris "<strong>HuK</strong>" Loranger is no stranger to the big stage. He's just typically been on the other side of the glass, under a noise-canceling headset.</p><p>But with the release of Overwatch, the StarCraft II Protoss player has found another calling: this time as a caster and analyst.</p><p>Behind the desk, HuK&#39;s tendency to say what he thinks &mdash; and back it up effectively &mdash; has proven a boon. He&#39;s casted at the post-launch Agents Rising event, and was an adamant supporter of North America as a caster and analyst at the $100,000 ESL Atlantic Showdown.</p><p>HuK has more casting in his future: he will be<a href="https://twitter.com/EL/status/776434728480026625"> an analyst</a> for the $300,000 Overwatch Open, a FACEIT and ELEAGUE collaboration that will broadcast the event&#39;s finals live on TBS.</p><p>But he's also been chosen by Team Canada captain and Cloud9 DPS player Lane "<strong>Surefour</strong>" Roberts to play for his country at the Overwatch World Cup later this year, which will take place at one of the biggest stages of all: BlizzCon.</p><p>Canada will have to make it through BlizzCon's opening week first, but it means that five years after his last appearance at the event — for the StarCraft II Invitational in 2011 — HuK could again take the stage at BlizzCon as a player.</p><p>theScore esports caught up with HuK to ask him how he feels about the nascent Overwatch esports landscape, how he'll balance his duties as a SC2 player with his Overwatch casting, and what he'll be doing to help Team Canada succeed on the world stage.</p><p><strong>When did you first decide that your involvement with Overwatch would be more than casual play? What made you realize that you wanted to cast Overwatch?</strong></p><p>I never really had a defining moment I guess, I played the game and enjoyed it first, then decided to be involved [in the scene]. From there, I casted Esports Arena [Agents Rising] tournament on release and ever since just got more and more opportunities to be involved.</p><p>Deciding to be a caster in OW comes from me always enjoying it in SC2 and being good at casting as well. After that I figured it would be the best way I could contribute to the scene, especially since I can still play the game at a high level and have coached/analyzed for pro teams as well.</p><p><strong>You were representing NA on the desk at Atlantic Showdown, but Europe proved to be pretty dominant. How close do you think NA’s best (probably EnVyUs) is to Europe right now? What went wrong in Cologne?</strong></p><p>Counting EnVyUs as NA is pretty funny, but I will take what I can get. I think that EnVyUs is still a Top 3 team in the world, possibly still first. Overall EnVyUs just had an off-day as well as some players being very inconsistent, not so surprising considering it was the first LAN event for OW.</p><p><strong>StarCraft II has very established tradition of both casting and observing. What is your opinion on the general state of casting and observing in Overwatch? </strong></p><p>I think both casting and observing in OW are lacking so far and needs help with content, stats, tools, etc... Casting in general is mixed — some people are very good at what they do, and some are not.</p><p>Observing is tough in OW, I feel like it is the biggest obstacle right now for the game as an Esport, I have confidence that Blizzard will give it more support in the near future.</p><p><strong>From what you’ve seen so far, how do you feel about ELEAGUE’s handling of competitive Overwatch?</strong></p><p>Hard to say. So far from working with them I have had no issues, but as far as I understand mostly FACEIT has been handling the process up to this point.</p><p><strong>How do you intend to balance your StarCraft II career with your Overwatch casting and playing? Where are your priorities right now?</strong></p><p>Work long hours and don’t have a lot of free time I guess, haha. I work pretty hard and know at some point I will have to make a choice one way or another but for right now I enjoy both immensely, so I plan to do both for now.</p><p><strong>You were chosen to play for Team Canada at the Overwatch World Cup. Specifically, you were chosen by the team’s captain, Surefour. How did that discussion start? What does that opportunity mean to you?</strong></p><p>Well, I was approached by Blizzard staff asking if I would like to be on the list of candidates and I thought 'of course.' Then I wasn’t sure how the voting or process was going to go, up until the very end. I was happy Surefour picked me. I will just do my best and I think I will bring a lot to the team.</p><p><strong>Can you confirm you will be playing support for Canada? What is your approach to that role?</strong></p><p>Actually as of right now that is pretty undecided. I think it is most likely I will play main tank or support. I think overall mechanically/competitive rank from last season I am middle of the pack as far as my team goes, probably being fourth. I will do whatever the team needs and what will make us most successful though.</p><p><strong>Has Canada done any practicing or scrimming so far? How are you feeling about your teammates?</strong></p><p>No not yet. I think most people are focusing on ELEAGUE for now and then afterwards there won’t be much as far as big tournaments so we will focus up then.</p><p>I think we have a good shot at going far at Blizzcon depending on the bracket/system they use and seeding. Most critics say we aren’t even a top 12 team anymore. I think I would be happy with Top 5, but Top 3 is always the goal.</p><p><strong>Given what we’ve seen, how do you view the future of Overwatch esports?</strong></p><p>I think the future looks very bright. Blizzard are taking it very seriously and have a good reputation for supporting their games so I am very optimistic.</p><p><em>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p><p><em>Josh "<strong>Gauntlet</strong>" Bury needs the inevitable Raynor skin for Soldier:76.<a href="http://twitter.com/ThrownGauntlet"> You can find him on Twitter</a>.</em></p><p><small><em>Copyright &copy; 2016 Score Media Ventures Inc.

                <![CDATA[<p>On Saturday, ByuN &quot;<strong>ByuN</strong>&quot; Hyun Woo slammed his way back onto the Korean StarCraft 2 scene, with a devastating 4-1 over 2015 WCS world champion Kim &quot;<strong>sOs</strong>&quot; Yoo Jin. It&#39;s a long way to come from where ByuN was a year and a half ago &mdash; i.e., nowhere at all. </p><p>During his prime in the late Wings of Liberty period, ByuN earned the nickname &quot;GhostKing&quot; for his pioneering use of mass Ghosts and Vikings in late-game TvP. The handle fit his playstyle, but it also came to represent his character as a player. ByuN has been elusive for much of StarCraft&#39;s adult life, and it&#39;s only recently that he has once again made his presence felt. But now that he&#39;s back, he&#39;s making it clear the King was never really dead.</p><p>First playing for ZeNEX and then for Prime, ByuN performed well in his first three years on the scene, but he struggled in 2013 to adapt to the new meta of Heart of the Swarm. He failed to reach Premier League in all three seasons of WCS Korea. In December that year, he disappeared from the competitive scene altogether.</p><p>He had been playing in team leagues, and he was supposed to play in the qualifiers for 2014 leagues &mdash; but he never actually did, and no one, at least in the foreign scene, knew where he&#39;d gone.</p><p>One of the better WoL Terrans (a two-time GSL semifinalist) became an enigmatic figure. Rumors of &quot;KeSPA jail&quot; began circulating. Fans would catch wind that he was signed up for a qualifier, only to be disappointed when he didn&#39;t show. When ByuN&#39;s Prime teammate MarineKing returned to play SC2, the team&#39;s coach indicated that ByuN would also make an appearance, but nothing came of it. ByuN was well and truly gone.</p><p>Then, almost a year and a half later &mdash; an eon in esports terms &mdash; ByuN played in the April 2015 Olimoleague. He won. </p><p>Over the following months, he tore his way through online cups, winning consistently online, but never appearing at a LAN. In October, Prime collapsed under the weight of a match-fixing scandal, and we learned ByuN was now playing for a Chinese squad called X-Team.</p><p>Back on the scene, ByuN quickly rose to prominence as one of the strongest players in the Legacy of the Void beta. He continued to dominate online after release, qualifying for his first LAN tournaments since his disappearance. He eventually made a deep run into the Top 4 at SSL Season 1, though in GSL he lost to Curious in Code A. </p><p>He struggled in the offline environment, visibly anxious during several matches. But little by little, fans got a better look at ByuN &mdash; the man who had gone from meta pioneer, to meme, and now was back to being one of the most feared forces in StarCraft.</p><p>What people saw, they liked. Legacy of the Void fit ByuN&#39;s strengths perfectly, and his masterful micro and multitasking were on full display. His Medivac/Tank micro was awe-inspiring, and his focus-fire on Banelings soon became a trademark move.</p><p>In May 2016, ByuN left X-Team and struck out on his own, qualifying this time for both Korean premier leagues. Soon those incredible tactical skills were on display on the biggest stages. ByuN was eliminated in the Ro16 of SSL by a combination of Solar and Classic, but in GSL he seemed untouchable. ByuN beat Losira, Seed, sOs and Dark in the group stages, before overcoming Ryung in a tight TvT series and then smashing Dear in the semis to reach the finals.</p><figure class="article-segment--embed"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/p3rt" width="560" height="310" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p>In his winner&#39;s interview after the series against Dear, ByuN revealed how he had prepared for the match. Without the structure of a team house &mdash; the readily available practice partners or the infrastructure &mdash; ByuN had gone further afield. He had reached out to a variety of players: Super, the Korean Protoss, but also the Chinese players Cyan and Jim, and the American prodigy Neeb (currently practicing in Korea). For guidance, he said he had relied on &quot;coach ByuN.&quot;</p><p>ByuN&#39;s win over sOs in the GSL finals is the latest chapter in the developing story of Korea&#39;s progaming infrastructure. Though KeSPA teams have proven that they can successfully produce superstars like Maru, Innovation, Stats, Dark and sOs, a handful of Koreans have flourished in the more lax environment of foreign teams or personal sponsorships.</p><figure class="article-segment--image"><a href="http://pgr21.com/pb/pb.php?id=gamenews&amp;no=7769" target="_blank"><img src="https://dqrt72khb0whk.cloudfront.net/uploads/image/file/11969/cropped_sosplane.jpg?ts=1473615393"><figcaption>sOs on the tailfin of a Jin Air jet.</figcaption></a></figure><p>Globe-trotting Koreans like Taeja, MC and HyuN are excellent examples of this. Players like FanTaSy have excelled only after joining a foreign team. Polt spent most of his career abroad as the only player under the CM Storm brand. Last year, Rain became the first player on a foreign team (mYinsanity) to win a GSL title.</p><p>But rarely has a player been so successful without any team to speak of. ByuN can&#39;t even rely on friends in Korea to practice with him in custom games, like Polt, for example, is able to do. ByuN has emerged from his mysterious disappearance as a lone wolf.</p><p>That makes his win all the more terrifying. ByuN not only defeated the two-time world champion, he did so with a fraction of the resources. sOs had teammates like Maru and Cure to help him with regular practice in TvP, but that didn&#39;t help.</p><p>And make no mistake &mdash; ByuN stomped him. After a wacky first game where both players attempted to proxy each other, ByuN maintained firm control of the series. Game 2 highlighted his incredible micro, from individual marine drop control to some of the best kiting we&#39;ve ever seen (fittingly, with a Ghost/Viking composition). </p><p>Game 3 on Dusk Towers was almost painful to watch, as ByuN slowly picked sOs apart. Game 4 was much the same. sOs looked shaky from Game 3 on, making a series of questionable tactical decisions. ByuN brought it home with an absolutely dominant Game 5 on Frost, showing near-perfect execution.</p><figure class="article-segment--embed"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/0g1v" width="560" height="319" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p>With that, ByuN made history by being the first teamless player to win a GSL title. He did so nearly alone, shortly after returning from an almost 18-month break without a professional match of StarCraft 2. Emerging from his disappearance, he has returned to become perhaps the best Terran in the world.</p><p>ByuN also seems like he&#39;s mastered his own demons. He&#39;s become more and more comfortable in an offline setting, and this season he&#39;s shown some of the best control we have ever seen in StarCraft 2. If ByuN can maintain his ridiculous micro and multitasking, while surviving alone in a world full of KeSPA team members, then Legacy of the Void will continue to reward the Ghost King with the best results of his interesting career.</p><p><em>Christian Paas-Lang is an esports journalist from Toronto who is hailing the new Terran church of ByuN, successor to Taeja. <a href="http://twitter.com/ChristianPaas">You can follow him on Twitter.</a></em></p><p><small><em>Copyright &copy; 2016 Score Media Ventures Inc.

                <![CDATA[<p>Kang <strong>"Solar"</strong> Min Soo and Park <strong>"Dark"</strong> Ryung Woo took it down to the wire in the final match of Season 2 of StarCraft 2 StarLeague, but this time it was Solar that pulled out the victory in Game 7.</p><p>The two Zergs traded the first four maps, bringing the scoreline 2-2. Solar was the one to upset the balance in Game 5 on Apotheosis, taking a 3-2 lead with two games in a row. Dark still managed to take Dusk Towers to even the scoreline, but in the final showdown on Frost, Solar made a bold choice to cheese out his opponent with a one-base Ling all-in, winning the match in dramatic fashion. </p><p>With this win — his first domestic championship title — Solar secures a guaranteed seed at the WCS Global Finals at BlizzCon in November, as well as $35,850 and 4,000 WCS points. Dark was already qualified for BlizzCon after winning SSL Season 1 in April.</p><p>Largely because of that earlier victory, Dark was the favored player to win this season of SSL, and Solar&#39;s narrow win comes as a minor upset. Dark has been on a tear in the Korean StarCraft scene and is seen by many as the top Zerg in Korea, particularly in ZvZ, where he has a 65 percent win rate for 2016 (not including the SSL Season 2 Finals). Solar, meanwhile, went 1-4 in his offline matches against Zergs this season.</p><p>Solar placed third in SSL Season 1, after falling to Dark 4-2 in the Winner's Finals and being eliminated by Kim <strong>"Stats"</strong> Dae Yeob. His performances this year have not been stellar — he fell out of GSL Season 2 in the Round of 32 after coming last in his group, losing to Koh <strong>"GuMiho"</strong> Byung Jae and Joo "<strong>Zest</strong>" Sung Wook. At Proleague he has failed to make an impact for Samsung Galaxy, losing to Rogue, ByuL, Curious and Dark throughout the year. </p><p>In a post-match <a href="http://sports.news.naver.com/esports/news/read.nhn?oid=442&amp;aid=0000043572">interview with Naver Sports</a> (<a href="http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/starcraft-2/513868-interview-with-the-winner-of-ssl-season-2">translated by Team Liquid</a>), Solar said the last year has been the hardest time in his career.</p><p>"My performance was terrible though I was quite experienced," he said. "However, with all the supports form my teammates and coaches, I could make a comeback. I considered myself a failure, because it's been five years and I have nothing since my debut, though I think I did my best. However, now I got it and it's so happy to be compensated for my efforts."</p><p><em>Olivia Da Silva is a news editor at theScore esports.

<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></figure><p>In addition to earning a spot at the World Championship Global Finals at Blizzcon, ByuN takes home ₩40 million ($33,840 USD) and 4,000 WCS Korea Points. </p><p>Based on historical results, ByuN's Protoss opponent was the likely favorite going into the Final match. Still, though sOs had won the WCS Global Finals at BlizzCon last year and ByuN had yet to win a Korean championship, the Terran made the series look surprisingly one-sided. After sOs managed to take King Sejong Station in Game 1, ByuN suffocated him out of the next four games with astonishing outplays and multitasking.</p><p>ByuN took a two-year break from playing in the GSL through 2014 and 2015, and returned at the beginning of this year. His Season 1 finish was lackluster, however — he didn't make it past the Round of 64 in Code A, getting knocked out 3-0 by Kim "<strong>Forte</strong>" Ki Yong. </p><p>His absence from the Korean pro scene makes it all the more shocking he was able to go all the way in Season 2. This is ByuN's strongest finish in any Korean Premier League, with his best prior result being Top 4 in GSL 2012 Season 3. ByuN is now also the first player to win the final of a Premier Korean League while being teamless.</p><p>The win cements a hot streak for ByuN, who took out Kim "<strong>Ryung</strong>" Dong Won 3-2 and Baek "<strong>Dear</strong>" Dong Jun 4-1 on his way to the Grand Finals. He finished first in his Round of 16 Group, knocking down sOs 2-0 and last season's SSL champion Park <strong>"Dark"</strong> Ryung Woo 2-1 to secure the group's first seed in the Round of 8. Though he finished 9th-12th at SSL this season, ByuN was able to hold his own in a stacked group featuring Kim "<strong>Classic</strong>" Doh Woo and Kang <strong>"Solar"</strong> Min Soo, right up until Classic eliminated him in Game 3 of the group decider match.</p><p>Fans will no doubt be looking to see how ByuN performs at BlizzCon two months from now, where he'll face off against the finest SC2 has to offer. ByuN joins five other players that have auto-qualified by winning championships this year: Dark, Joo "<strong>Zest</strong>" Sung Wook, Tobias "<strong>ShoWTimE</strong>" Sieber, Choi "<strong>Polt</strong>" Seong Hun and Bang <strong>"TRUE"</strong> Tae Soo. Though the competition will be stiff, if he maintains his current form, ByuN has a good shot at a high placement.</p><p><em>Preston Dozsa is a news editor for theScore esports. <a href="https://twitter.com/prestondozsa?lang=en">You can follow him on Twitter.</a></em></p><p><em>Jeff Fraser is a supervising editor for theScore esports.</em></p><p><small><em>Copyright &copy; 2016 Score Media Ventures Inc.

Prior to that, he won IEM Shanghai with a 4-2 victory over Alex "<strong>Neeb</strong>" Sunderhaft and placed 3rd-4th at Dreamhack Leipzig. He joined AT Gaming in 2013 after leaving LowLandLions.</p><p>uThermal has one last shot to qualify for BlizzCon. Should he place either first or second at the WCS Copa International in Mexico, he could secure the last 230 points he needs to lock in a seed to the WCS World Finals. </p><p>"In all honesty I haven't been preparing too much," uThermal said in Liquid's press release. "I've had a lot to deal with recently. I also really wanted to take a small break to rest after DreamHack Valencia, and I haven't had the time after that all the way until after the Copa qualifiers, so I'm finally enjoying some time to chill out. </p><p>"That said though I'm still pretty confident in my ability to reach the finals. I think I've shown high level play in every tournament I've played since IEM, and I do really think I can make it. My opponents this tournament seem particularly difficult though so we'll just have to see."</p><p>uThermal is set to play against Shin &quot;<strong>Hydra</strong>&quot; Dong Won in his first match of the Copa International. Last time they played was at DreamHack Valencia, where Hydra defeated uThermal 3-1, though uThermal says he wasn&#39;t in fighting shape at the time and is more ready now.</p><p>"DreamHack Valencia was my personal worst event of the year, and I think both me and Hydra know that series was way different than what our rematch will look like," uThermal stated in the press release. "Even in the group stages I struggled pretty hard back then and I have improved a lot." </p><p>"I do think Hydra is a really difficult Zerg to face as Terran and it will be a real challenge. I don't have anything special planned but I have a feeling my standard play will be enough."</p><p><em>Daniel Rosen is a news editor for theScore esports. <a href="http://twitter.com/daniel_rosen">You can follow him on Twitter.</a></em></p><p><small><em>Copyright &copy; 2016 Score Media Ventures Inc.

                <![CDATA[<p>As region-locking came into effect, one Code S-level Zerg went against the grain and decided to risk it all to come compete in the foreign scene. He left behind his home, his family, his friends, all his established connections in Korea. He joined a North American team, and hoped to make it big outside of Korea, just like the legendary globe-trotting Koreans of the Wings of Liberty days.</p><p>He succeeded, bursting onto the scene with impressive mechanics and stage experience. It wasn't long before he won a championship, achieving more in a few months of North American play than he had in years in Korea.</p><p>Sound familiar? That's because that's Hydra's story, not TRUE's. But there are quite a few parallels.</p><p>When Hydra first made the leap across the Pacific in 2015, he was going against the tide of Korean players returning to Korea from Europe and North America after region-locking first came into effect. In his first tournament, he looked unstoppable, before Polt pulled off a remarkable comeback win. Still, he netted himself a title in Season 2 of that year, earning himself more in 2015 than in the entire 2012-2014 period.</p><p>Hydra flourished in the foreign environment, not only defeating foreigner after foreigner, but drastically upping his win rate against Koreans as well. Just a few months later he was in the finals of the combined WCS Season 1. A few months after that, he stormed his way to a championship in Season 2.</p><figure class="article-segment--image"><img src="https://dqrt72khb0whk.cloudfront.net/uploads/image/file/3645/cropped_IMG_6724.jpg?ts=1435534786"><figcaption>Hydra wins WCS 2015 Season 2, 4-2 over Lilbow.</figcaption></figure><p>TRUE had more success in Korea than Hydra did. He was a regular Round of 32 performer in the GSL, and made the semifinals in 2014. In DreamHack: Moscow and DreamHack: Tours, he also made the semis, before losing to Curious in the finals at DreamHack: Valencia in 2015.</p><p>TRUE joined Psistorm Gaming near the end of last year, and from there worked to obtain a visa to compete in the now even more strictly region-locked WCS Circuit. Throughout the process he struggled in Korea, only reaching Code A in Season 1. He once again made Code S in Season 2, but somewhat astonishingly forfeited his seed to move to North America once the visa came through.</p><p>Unlike Hydra, however, TRUE didn't have the same instant impact in the foreign scene. He reached the quarterfinals of HomeStory Cup XIII, but fell there to a somewhat-resurgent Scarlett, 3-2. He didn't compete in either DreamHack: Valencia or IEM Shanghai.</p><p>TRUE's defeat at HomeStory Cup sparked a great deal of discussion in the foreign community. Was it true that Korean Zergs were actually just bad (they have been struggling greatly this year)? Had foreigners closed the skill gap so dramatically? The foreign scene had gotten used to a beatable Polt, Hydra and viOLet, but TRUE was fresh from Code S.</p><p>Then along came the WCS Circuit Summer Championship, and we get at least of few answers.</p><p>First of all, TRUE is good at StarCraft. His micro intensive Zergling usage and strong tactical sense makes up for some occasionally sloppy macro &mdash; or perhaps it causes it. His heavy counter-attack style is reminiscent of Life and, as we saw in Valencia, the young Italian Reynor. Most of his games ended not with a decisive fight, army against army, but with an economy-gutting Zergling run-by or Baneling drop. And in a TvZ meta that is still dominated by Roach/Ravager compositions, TRUE routinely used Zerling/Baneling compositions against HeRoMaRinE and Polt, even using the seldom-seen Mutalisks in some games.</p><p>TRUE was in form this event, tearing through Snute 3-0, Harstem 3-0, and a surprisingly strong Welmu 3-0. His first lost was to the similarly in form HeRoMarinE, but he took that series 3-1. With only a single dropped map to Polt in the final, he finished the tournament with a 16-2 record.</p><p>That dominance from TRUE distracted from a host of side stories that played out through the three days of competition. The strength of the Korean contingent was one such storyline. While TRUE and Polt took over the tournament, TRUE&#39;s spiritual precursor, Hydra, had a disappointing first round loss to Welmu. viOLet, meanwhile, lost to MajOr, who showed some of his old talent. A mixed bag, at least.</p><figure class="article-segment--image"><img src="https://dqrt72khb0whk.cloudfront.net/uploads/image/file/8426/cropped_20160305_joe-brady_iemktw-sc2_226_25287318940_o.jpg?ts=1457624110"><figcaption>Snute's first-round elimination comes after a strong showing in China</figcaption></figure><p>TRUE&#39;s run also underscored a disappointing first round loss for Snute, fresh off a title in China and still one of the most dangerous foreigners in 2016. Similarly, TRUE overshadowed an exceptionally strong performance from HeRoMaRinE, who fought his way through three tough matches against ShoWTiMe, MarineLorD and MajOr.</p><p>Finally, a great showing by the hometown hero Scarlett made up for MaSa's unexpected defeat, but it was Neeb who had the strength to move on to the semifinals to face Polt, as he beat the Canadian Zerg 3-0. Neeb would lose that now classic matchup, giving Polt the edge in their career head-to-head, 4-3.</p><p>Overall, this is TRUE&#39;s first real tournament in the foreign scene, and he nailed it. He won, and he won in his own style, tearing apart his opponents with counterattacks and being almost irresponsibly reliant on a Zergling/Baneling composition.</p><p>He looked just about as strong as Hydra did when he first came to America in Season 1 of last year. But this time when the Korean Zerg met Polt in the final, the Zerg won. If that is anything more than an interesting coincidence, WCS players should be very, very scared of TRUE.</p><p>TRUE has broken into the scene, now all remains is to see how far he can go. Like Hydra, Polt and viOLet, TRUE is here to stay, and that opens up a lot of opportunities for more showings like this. After losing to Polt in Season 1, Hydra barely skipped a beat before winning it all in Season 2. It was only later that the ROOT Gaming Zerg slowed down &mdash; or the rest of the competition sped up.</p><p>TRUE has already won his championship, what's next?</p><p><em>Christian Paas-Lang is an esports journalist from Toronto, who shed a tear when he typed out l-i-f-e in this article. <a href="http://twitter.com/ChristianPaas">You can follow him on Twitter.</a></em></p><p><small><em>Copyright &copy; 2016 Score Media Ventures Inc.

                <![CDATA[<p><em>Ahead of the WCS Summer Championship, the staff at theScore esports took the opportunity to sit down and predict some of the outcomes of the tournament.</em></p><h3><strong>Who will win the WCS Summer Championship? </strong></h3><p><strong>Christian Paas-Lang: </strong>My<strong> </strong>head and heart say Neeb. It seems like he's been getting more and more comfortable at LANs as the year goes on, and this is his time to really step up. Add that to the fact he's been in Korea and I think he has the edge to win it. My guess is that he'll meet Snute in the final and take the set 4-3.</p><p><strong>Simmy Fong:</strong> My head says Neeb will win. He’s been so consistent leading up to this tournament, constantly improving and he’s been training in Korea. It would be incredible to see him play against his rival, Hydra, in the finals, but I think it’ll be Neeb taking on viOLet with a 4-2 victory. My heart says that MaSa deserves to finally win a championship and what better place to do it than on home turf.</p><p><strong>Connor Dunn:</strong> I’ve been a huge Snute fan ever since his amazing series against CJ.herO at IEM Toronto. He’s also coming into this event on a hot streak after defeating recent IEM Shanghai Champion uThermal en route to his first place finish at NEO Star League.</p><p><strong>Navneet Randhawa: </strong>I think Neeb will win, but my heart says Snute. Although Snute was knocked out of IEM Shanghai during the Round-of-16 to uThermal, he was able to bounce back and win the NSL 2016 International shortly after. But with that said, Neeb's been on the rise for some time now, and I feel like this will be his tournament to shine. The finals will come down to Neeb vs. Snute, and Neeb will take it 4-3.</p><h3><strong>Who will do the best from each race?</strong></h3><p><strong>Paas-Lang: </strong>Zerg - Snute has a very tough bracket, but has a chance at the finals. His real challenge will be whoever comes out of the top bracket in the semifinals (ShoWTimE, MarineLorD or MaSa) as well as Hydra, but Snute has been so consistent this year that it's hard to bet against him. Ever since WCS switched over to a weekend format, Snute has been crushing it.</p><p>Terran - As long as Polt has been practicing, he should be able to take advantage of a relatively easy road to the semifinals, where only SortOf could surprise him.</p><p>Protoss - Neeb does the best. Neeb wins. America is great again.</p><p><strong>Fong: </strong>Zerg - It’s tough for me to pick just one. viOLet had improved a lot going into Shanghai as he defeated the Valencia champion Nerchio in a close 3-2 and just barely fell short of appearing in the Grand Final after losing 3-2 to the eventual champion uThermal. viOLet needs a strong showing here if he wants to go to BlizzCon.</p><p>Terran - The easy answer would be the Shanghai champion uThermal, but I predicted Neeb to win the tournament so that wouldn’t work. On the other side of the bracket we have MaSa who time and time again finds a way to impress me in these stacked tournaments. With no Protoss in his path until potentially the quarterfinals, he has a great chance to place higher than any other Terran at this tournament.</p><p>Protoss - Neeb is going to win, what more is there to say?</p><p><strong>Dunn: </strong>Zerg - It feels like ages ago, but Snute actually took second place at the Winter Championships in Katowice. There’s just no way you can count him out when it comes to going far in an event this size.</p><p>Terran - I feel like it’s either Polt or uThermal but with the way the brackets worked out, Polt has a higher chance of going further with uThermal likely having to face Neeb in the Round-of-16.</p><p>Protoss - The obvious choice is Neeb. He’s earned the respect of the entire Starcraft community while being known as the strongest foreign Protoss. And with second place finishes at both DreamHack Austin and IEM Shanghai, he’s got the results to back it up.</p><p><strong>Randhawa: </strong>Zerg - Snute is an A-grade student — he always produces good results, though 2016 has been a blend of second and 3-4th place finishes.</p><p>Terran: Polt will probably make it in the quarterfinals or semifinals, but then lose to a foreigner. His preparation will definitely be there, but it won’t be up to speed against his opponents the deeper he gets into the tournament.</p><p>Protoss: It’s Neeb! Do I <em>Neeb</em> to say more?</p><h3><strong>Who will underperform, who will over-perform?</strong></h3><p><strong>Paas-Lang: </strong>I think that even after a strong showing at IEM Shanghai, viOLet will underperform in Montreal. He's strong, but he has a very tough bracket ahead of him and I think MaSa or PtitDrogo has what is takes if Kelazhur doesn't. Similarly, I don't think uThermal can repeat his impressive run from Shanghai.</p><p>Polt will over-perform simply because he's been out of the picture for a while (Round-of-32 in Valencia, did not participate in Shanghai), but my real answer is Elazer. I think he has a real shot at the semifinals depending on how strong Polt is right now.</p><p><strong>Fong: </strong>Polt has been quiet ever since he won the Winter Circuit Championship, placing 3rd-4th in spring, and completely missing in summer. I’m not sure how much he’s been practicing and he hasn’t been streaming nearly as much. I expect him to beat ShaDoWn but he could very well lose in the next round to SortOf.</p><p>Hydra has had a mental block going up against Neeb in the past few tournaments, but now that they’re on opposite sides of the bracket we could very well see him tear his way through to the semis.</p><p><strong>Dunn: </strong>I am expecting Nerchio to perform relatively well (especially after his first place finish at DreamHack Valencia) but unfortunately I just can’t see him getting past either Neeb or uThermal.</p><p>Masa is my pick for over-performing. He has to be kicking himself for sleeping in at DreamHack Valencia and missing his matches. Hopefully that will light a fire under the young Terran player and he can show the world what he’s really made of.</p><p><strong>Randhawa: </strong> Hydra’s last big win was at DreamHack Austin back in May, but since then, he hasn’t been able to perform as well. Neeb took him out 3-1 during the Spring Circuit, and 3-0’d him during DreamHack Valencia and IEM Shanghai respectively. Lucky for Hydra, Neeb is on the opposite side of the bracket. However, I feel that his play won’t be up to par.</p><p>We’ve called MaSa the “King in the North” for many years since he wins all of the local Toronto tournaments. This has been a good year for him, so I think his preparation for this event will be that much greater, and he will show us some great games.</p><div> </div><h3><strong>Which Canadian will go the farthest?</strong></h3><p><strong>Paas-Lang</strong>: MaSa is the only sensible answer here. He's by far the strongest Canadian this year. He has a long way to go in the upper bracket, but unless Scarlett has come back from Korea with her old strength, I don't see her getting past Nerchio, let alone "literal god" Neeb.</p><p><strong>Fong: </strong>MaSa desperately needs all the points he can get here to make it to BlizzCon. I think he’s easily the best out of the Canadian players participating and has the strongest drive to make it far in this tournament.</p><p><strong>Dunn</strong>: If MaSa beats MajOr in the Round of 32, he could easily make it to the Semifinals. Unfortunately I don’t see Scarlett going far, even with the home crowd advantage, just because of the way the bracket turned out.</p><p><strong>Randhawa: </strong>If MaSa is able to pull it together, he will be the Canadian who will go the furthest. It has been some time since Scarlett has achieved the greatness that was a few years ago, Semper is on the right path, but not quite on the same level as MaSa. So here’s to our Toronto boy MaSa.</p><div> </div><h3><strong>Who's a dark horse to watch out for?</strong></h3><div> </div><p><strong>Paas-Lang: </strong>I feel like I always pick either Serral or Elazer, so this time I'm going to pick another European Zerg, SortOf, who has a very strong run in Shanghai and I feel has a chance to cause a ruckus in the lower bracket.</p><p><strong>Fong: </strong>Cham made a name for himself at the Spring Circuit Championship surprising many by taking out Bly 3-0 and Jim 3-1 to make it to the quarterfinals. We haven’t heard much from him since but he’s definitely who I would look out for.</p><p><strong>Dunn: </strong>While MaNa has won several events this season, he has expressed multiple times that he is having a tough time understanding the current meta. Maybe he has found a playstyle that works for him and can fly under the radar coming into this major event.</p><p><strong>Randhawa: </strong>Katy Perry. But in all seriousness, uThermal. He will definitely beat Serral in the Ro32, but the face-off with Neeb in the Ro16 may prove to be an intense matchup. He did defeat Neeb in the IEM Shanghai finals with an outcome of 4-2, but I really hope Neeb can make it out.</p><p><small><em>Copyright &copy; 2016 Score Media Ventures Inc. All rights reserved.

The amount that Choya owes me is around 6,000+ USD," he wrote. </p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/4vklyy/gumiho_owed_over_5000_from_invasion_esports/d5zfazl?context=3">He also said that</a> GuMiho had never had to pay for his own plane tickets, "Except one time where it was asked last minute to attempt an event."</p><p>After Sebou started posting on Reddit, Choya shared chat logs ranging over several months depicting Choya asking about outstanding payments and Sebou citing roadblocks ranging from <a href="https://twitter.com/mvpchoya">technical issues with PayPal</a> to his <a href="https://twitter.com/MVPChoya/status/760141840481792001">credit cards expiring</a>.</p><p>On Reddit, Sebou shared his <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/4vmcug/choya_claims/d5zsn7z?context=3">own collection of chat logs</a> in which Choya appears to give permission to Sebou to use GuMiho&#39;s prize money to pay for him to attend Dreamhack: Tours. <a href="https://twitter.com/MVPChoya/status/760180940576395264">On Twitter</a>, Choya claims Sebou&#39;s chat logs are forgeries.</p><p>&quot;He forged this conversation, it&#39;s not authentic i never said something like this nor understand english like this,&quot; he wrote. He also <a href="https://twitter.com/MVPChoya/status/760173841658195968">shared a new message from Sebou</a> telling him to call in a lawyer if he wanted to take things further.</p><p>This is isn't the first time Sebou has been accused of dodging payments. Earlier this year, Yi "<strong>Legend</strong>" Seon Jeong, the head coach of Afreeca Freecs also claimed Invasion owed them money in a Tweet saying "If you don't keep your end of the contract by this week we'll take action."</p><figure class="article-segment--embed"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/KingSebou">@KingSebou</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/InvEsport">@InvEsport</a> We've waited patiently for enough time.

Once he returned from his leave, he says that the organization did not put him back on full salary.</p><p>"Ultimately upon returning, I've been practicing a heck of a lot, and even have more games than Kas to put that into perspective. But with LANs and events happening my team never contacted me to go as a player, but organisations such as TakeTV or Dreamhack would contact me if I would play and cast in their tournaments respectively," he wrote. "A few players asked why I wasn't partaking in DH Valencia while there and the answer which kinda made me sad at the time was 'It was never an option.' Even though practice resumed and everything that goes along with being a Pro Gamer. Full Salary never returned, and even half salary was something I seemingly had to argue for, it wasn't something i wanted to deal with."</p><p>The Terran player previously played for EG for several years, leaving <a data-in-app-uri="thescoreesports:///news/111" href="http://www.thescoreesports.com/news/111">the NA team in 2015</a> because he wanted to move back to Europe. <a data-in-app-uri="thescoreesports:///news/6034" href="http://www.thescoreesports.com/news/6034">He joined Euronics in February</a> alongside Zerg players Artur &quot;<strong>Nerchio</strong>&quot; Bloch and S&eacute;bastien &quot;<strong>FireCake</strong>&quot; Lebbe.</p><p>While DeMusliM is leaving Euronics, he will not be leaving the competitive scene, saying that his father&#39;s death has given him perspective.</p><p>&quot;My goals changed since returning, with my father passing I truly realized that competition is what I love. I&#39;ll be streaming and such going into the future and looking for a new team, but I want to compete, that&#39;s majorly what I want to be doing right now,&quot; he said.</p><p><em>Sasha Erfanian is a news editor for theScore esports. <a href="https://twitter.com/SashaErfanian">Follow him on Twitter</a>, it'll be great for his self-esteem.</em></p><p><small><em>Copyright &copy; 2016 Score Media Ventures Inc.
