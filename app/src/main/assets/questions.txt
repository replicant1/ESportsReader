To what extent can the "official" eSportsReader app available through Google Play be considered a
good solution to this problem? Is there anything wrong with it, that you know of?

USER STORY 3: "As a user I want to minimise data usage so that I don't burn through my data quota"
===========================
Possible strategies to implement:

(1) Don't eagerly load all entries for all feeds for all sports at startup time. Just lazily load
    entries as needed (when clicked upon by user).
(2) Just having a cache (also needed for USER STORY 4) could be viewed as satisfying this story,
    as it means I can review an entry as many times as I want, though it will only be loaded
    over the network once (into the app's persistent cache).
(3) Don't load images unless the user specifies to (e.g. replace with [Touch image to load], as
    per the "official" ESR app).
(4) Use conditional GET requests ("If-Modified-Since" header) when retrieving XML, so that we
    don't unnecessarily load data that is identical to what we already have stored locally.

USER STORY 1: "As a user I want to pick the Sport/Source/Entries" that interest me so that I can
read news that I care about".
=============================

Possible strategies to implement:

(1) Don't display all entries at once. Provide user navigation between sport, source and entries
    so that users can select what interests them (as you would expect from any feed reader).

(2) Have a "favourites" facility, that can be applied to entries sports, blogs, or just individual
    feeds. Let the user display/refresh "favouries only".
